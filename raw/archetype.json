        "text": "Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.\r\n\r\n### Fast and Agile\r\n_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement. \r\n\r\n### Deft Hands\r\n_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.\r\n\r\nSome of your deft hand maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Deft Hands save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Hinder\r\nYou attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Pilfer\r\nYou attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Tumble\r\nYou attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.\r\n\r\n### Supreme Sneak\r\n_**Acquisitions Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.\r\n\r\n### Aerial Agility\r\n_**Acquisitions Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYour agility in the air grants you the following benefits:\r\n- When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.\r\n- Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.\r\n\r\n### Thief's Reflexes\r\n_**Acquisitions Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.",

When you make a weapon attack with your weapon while hidden, Investigation and Perception checks made to locate you that rely on sound have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Shock Absorber\r\nYou add a reclamation device to your modified weapon to gather energy from the surroundings when it is present. While wielding your modified weapon, you can cast the _absorb energy_ tech power and the power's extra damage applies to both melee and ranged weapon attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Siege Weapon\r\nYou modify your weapon to be more effective against barriers. Your weapon deals double damage against structures.\r\n\r\n#### Shocking Harpoon\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Harpoon Reel_\r\nAfter hitting a creature with the harpoon fire mode, you can use the connection to deliver an at-will tech power. As a bonus action, you can cast an at-will tech power at the target with a range of touch. If the power \r\n\r\nrequires an attack roll, you have advantage. If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the harpoon.\r\n\r\n#### Shocking Oscillator\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Vibroweapon_\r\nWhen you hit with the weapon, you can create an electronic burst. Each creature in a 15-foot cone centered on the creature you hit must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC, taking 1d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Snap Fire\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Blaster_\r\nYou modify your modified blaster weapon for quick shots. You can use your reaction to take a opportunity attack with your modified weapon if an enemy comes within 10 feet of you. You have disadvantage on this attack. \r\n\r\n#### Staggering Oscillator\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Vibroweapon_\r\nWhen you hit with the weapon, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Tracker\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou add a tracking mechanism to your modified weapon. The tracker has 3 charges. As a bonus action you can use 1 charge to cast _target lock_. As an action you can use 2 charges to cast _detect invisibility_.\r\n\r\nThe tracker regains all expended charges after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Truelight\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Flashlight_\r\nYou modify your flashlight with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your flashlight. When toggled on, for the next minute your flashlight now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Venomous Oscillator\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Vibroweapon_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can coat your weapon in a thin layer of poison for 1 minute. The next time you hit with the weapon, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.",

Leading with a blaster and pure, unbridled rage, the berserker never lets an empty gun diminish their fury.\r\n\r\n### Firestorm\r\n_**Ballistic Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- You can use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls of blaster weapons against targets within 30 feet of you. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n- When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.\r\n\r\n### Explosive\r\n_**Ballistic Approach:** 3rd and 9th level_\r\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a blaster weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.\r\n- You add your rage damage to damage rolls from ranged weapon attacks using Strength. \r\n- At 9th level, when a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against your burst or rapid property, you can add your Brutal Critical dice to the damage.\r\n\r\n### Rampage\r\n_**Ballistic Approach:** 6th level_\r\nWhile raging, when you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target. You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Down, Not Out\r\n_**Ballistic Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhen you are hit with an attack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.\r\n\r\n### Brawn\r\n_**Ballistic Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one.

They tap into these powers to cloud the minds of their foes, distracting and diverting before abruptly dispatching them.\r\n\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Beguiler Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Fascinating Display\r\n_**Beguiler Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Mesmerizing Presence\r\n_**Beguiler Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.\r\n\r\n### Enthralling Vigor\r\n_**Beguiler Practice:** 13th level_\r\nWhenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Distracting Countenance\r\n_**Beguiler Practice:** 17th level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can mask yourself with the Force for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.\r\n\r\n##### Beguiler Practice Forcecasting\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.",

        "text": "Some scouts find themselves far from civilization not to hunt, gather intelligence, or escape danger, but to venture forth simply to defend those unable to defend themselves. Followers of the Bulwark Technique make use of advanced technology to contain those that threaten the undeserving.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in heavy armor.\r\n\r\n### Personal Barrier\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\nWhenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\r\n\r\nWhile the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.\r\n- Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Bulwark\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature makes a melee attack against a friendly creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the attack to target you instead. If the attack hits, and your Personal Barrier has hit points, the attacking creature takes bonus damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.\r\n\r\n### Projected Barrier\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 7th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou've learned how to manipulate your barrier to create new effects. As an action, you can spend three of your barrier's hit points to create a unique effect. You have three such effects: Projected Sphere, Projected Maelstrom, and Projected Wave. When you use your Projected Barrier, you choose which effect to create.\r\n\r\nSome Projected Barrier Effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nIf your barrier's hit points are reduced to 0, any Projected Barrier features immediately end.\r\n\r\n#### Projected Sphere\r\nYou create a protective spherical barrier in a 5-foot-radius sphere a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures within the barrier have three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the barrier. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Projected Maelstrom\r\nYou create an unstable energy maelstrom in a 5-foot cube at a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. A creature takes 4d4 energy damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required). \r\n\r\nThis feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (5d4) and 17th level (6d4).\r\n\r\n#### Projected Wave\r\nYou create a wave of barrier energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 energy damage and is pushed back to the edge of the cone. On a success, they take half damage and aren't pushed.\r\n\r\nThis feature's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).\r\n\r\n### Regenerative Shielding\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen a hostile creature forces you to make a saving throw and you succeed, your personal barrier regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Barrier\r\n_**Bulwark Technique:** 15th level_\r\nWhen your personal barrier takes damage, you can have it gain resistance to subsequent damage of that type until the start of your next turn (no action required). If it takes damage of more than one type simultaneously, you can choose which type it gains resistance to. Your barrier can only have resistance to one type of damage at a time.",

If you are already proficient in light and medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing armor as long as you are not wielding a shield.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you've learned to adapt to new weaponry.

If you avoid moving, you gain a +10 bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect.\r\n\r\n### Sovereign Protector\r\n_**Crimson Order:** 17th level_\r\nYour mastery of focus has allowed you to unlock your fullest potential in combat. As a bonus action, you can gain the following effects for 1 minute.\r\n- Your speed is doubled.\r\n- Your AC increases by 2.\r\n- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.\r\n- You gain an additional action of each of your turns.

You gain the following benefits. Choose two types of weapons to be your Echani weapons: one vibroweapon and one blaster. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial \r\n\r\nweapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it.

You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.\r\n\r\n#### Echani's Shot\r\nYou can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type.

The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.\r\n\r\n### Unerring Accuracy\r\n_**Echani Order:** 17th level_\r\nYour mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy.

If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. \r\n\r\n#### Physical Barrier\r\nYou project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. \r\n\r\n### Versatile Direction\r\n_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou can take a second bonus action on each of your turns. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Reinforced Barriers\r\n_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Barrier\r\n_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 18th level_\r\nWhen a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.\r\n\r\n### Gadgeteer Modifications\r\nIf a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Grounding System\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level, Prototype Grounding System_\r\nWhile wearing your gadgeteer harness you have immunity to lightning damage.\r\n\r\n#### Auto-Injection Regenerator\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou install a special kolto injector into your gadgeteer harness that can inject you with kolto in response to pain.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while your jet pack is active, you can cast *flame sweep* using your bonus action instead of your action.\r\n\r\n#### Frailcasting Inhibitor\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to the tech save DC of powers you cast that requires a Strength or Constitution saving throw. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Grounding System\r\nWhile wearing your gadgeteer harness you are immune to the shocked condition.\r\n\r\n#### Integrated Amplifier\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to melee tech attack rolls.

This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Core Override\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou can cast the *override interface* tech power at 5th level without spending tech points.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Jet Pack\r\nYou integrate a jet pack into your gadgeteer harness to grant you temporary, limited flight. Activating or deactivating the jets requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. \r\n\r\nThe jet pack last for 1 minute before deactivating. Once the jets have been activated, they can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nYour jet pack's speed increases to 40 feet at 5th level, 50 feet at 9th level, 60 feet at 13th level, 70 feet at 17th level, and 80 feet at 20th level.\r\n\r\n#### Mechanical Arm\r\nYou create a mechanical arm which mounts to your shoulder, which you can use independently. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time.\r\n\r\nYou can choose this modification twice.\r\n\r\n#### Mimicker\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou create a device that attaches to your gadgeteer harness. Your mimicker casts a shadow that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function for 1 minute. Your mimicker is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.\r\n\r\n#### Miniaturized Hydraulics\r\nYour gadgeteer harness can store 20 pounds of equipment without adding to your encumbrance.\r\n\r\n#### Oil Spill\r\nAs an action, you can cast the *oil slick* tech power without expending tech points. When you cast the power in this way, the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Powered Grappling Hook\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook_\r\nWhile your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype Grounding System\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Grounding System_\r\nWhile wearing your gadgeteer harness you have resistance to lightning damage.\r\n\r\n#### Rendcasting Inhibitor\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to the tech save DC of powers you cast that requires a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Quick Start Engine\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level, Jet Pack_\r\nYou can now activate your Jet Pack as an object interaction rather than as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Recycled Adrenals\r\nYou can augment a single adrenal to regain its charge. This adrenal can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this adrenal, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Recycled Explosives\r\nYou can augment a single explosive to regain its charge. This explosive can only be used by you, and it uses your tech save DC instead of its own, unless its own DC would be higher. Once you've used this explosive, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Recycled Stimpacs\r\nYou can augment a single stimpac to regain its charge. This stimpac can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this stimpac, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Sentry Turret\r\nYou learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional d4 damage for each sentry beyond the first.\r\n\r\nThe sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Shocking Hook\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook_\r\nAfter hitting a creature with your grappling hook, you can use the connection to deliver an at-will tech power. As a bonus action, you can cast an at-will tech power at the target with a range of touch. If the power requires an attack roll, you have advantage. If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the hook.\r\n\r\n#### Stealth Field Generator\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou create an augmented belt that functions as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.\r\n\r\nOnce the belt has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Shocking Barrier\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou enhanced your barriers. Whenever a creature with one of your barriers active takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of it, the damaged creature can roll your Potent Aptitude die, dealing the result of the die as lightning damage to the creature that damaged it.\r\n\r\n#### Truesight Goggles\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Darkvision Goggles_\r\nYou modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Weapon Integration\r\nYou can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your gadgeteer harness. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties. \r\n\r\n#### Withercasting Inhibitor\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to the tech save DC of powers you cast that requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook\r\nYou craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.\r\n\r\nA creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.\r\n\r\nWhile the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.",

        "text": "\r\nNot all studied men and women use their intelligence and skill for the pursuit of knowledge, but instead turn to the various casinos and betting halls of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Gambler Pursuit use their knowledge of probability and risk to attempt to master games of chance and build their fortune, or lose it all along the way.\r\n\r\n### Gambler's Aptitude\r\n_**Gambler Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with your choice of gaming set and your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Risk versus Reward\r\n_**Gambler Pursuit:** 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nWhen you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThis die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Lucky Number 7\r\n_**Gambler Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain an expended superiority die. \r\n\r\nWhen attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.\r\n\r\n### Tell Me the Odds\r\n_**Gambler Pursuit:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nIf the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).\r\n\r\nThis die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Borrowed Luck\r\n_**Gambler Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.\r\n\r\nWhile you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any \r\n\r\nunused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Gambler Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Ace Up Your Sleeve\r\nWhenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.\r\n\r\n#### Against the House\r\nWhenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.\r\n\r\n#### Ante Up\r\nWhen you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.\r\n\r\n#### Calculated Bluff\r\nWhen you make an ability check using Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).\r\n\r\n#### Cold Read\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nAs an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.\r\n\r\n#### Feeling the Pressure\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Take a Chance\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nBefore making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.\r\n\r\n#### The Magic Number\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nWhenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.",

Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Trick Shooter\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot. \r\n\r\nSome of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Trick Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Blinding Shot\r\nYou attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n#### Brutal Shot\r\nYou attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  \r\n\r\n#### Hampering Shot\r\nYou attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n### Spinning Flourish\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n### Ricochet Shot\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Quickdraw\r\n_**Gunslinger Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted. Choose up to six such creatures that you can see, making a ranged weapon attack against each. On a hit, you deal normal weapon damage and can apply a single trick shot to each attack made this way. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.",

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn, and this damage is the same type as the weapon's damage. \r\n\r\n#### Giant Killer\r\nWhen a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature. \r\n\r\n#### Horde Breaker\r\nOnce on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon, no action required.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Hunter\r\n_**Hunter Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you use your Ranger's Quarry feature, the first time you make a tech or weapon attack against the target of your Ranger's Quarry each turn, roll your Ranger's Quarry die and add it to the roll.\r\n\r\n### Defensive Tactics \r\n_**Hunter Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features of your choice. \r\n\r\n#### Escape the Horde\r\nOpportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Multiattack Defense\r\nWhen a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn. \r\n\r\n#### Steel Will\r\nYou have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\r\n\r\n### Multiattack \r\n_**Hunter Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features of your choice. \r\n\r\n#### Volley\r\nYou can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range.

Those guardians who focus on Makashi Form utilize calculated blade manipulation, intense focus, and expert timing to confuse and trap their opponents.\r\n\r\n### Form Basics\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the Makashi lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.\r\n\r\n### The Way of the Ysalamiri\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can enter an offensive stance for one minute. While in this stance, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to the first melee weapon attack and damage rolls you make each turn.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the following Channel the Force option.\r\n\r\n#### Makashi Riposte\r\nWhen another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and use your reaction to attempt to deflect the attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your guardian level.\r\n\r\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack against that creature as a part of the reaction.\r\n\r\n### Shatterpoint\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 7th level_\r\nIf you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can use your connection to the Force to sense their strengths and weaknesses, and learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The GM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:\r\n\r\n- Strength score\r\n- Dexterity score\r\n- Wisdom score\r\n- Charisma score\r\n- Armor Class\r\n- Current hit points\r\n- Total class levels (if any)\r\n- Total Forcecaster levels (if any)\r\n\r\n### Glancing Blow\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 15th level_\r\nWhen an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.\r\n\r\n### Master of Contention\r\n_**Makashi Form:** 20th level_\r\nYou are a duelist of the highest caliber.  Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage, and you ignore resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n- All melee attacks have disadvantage against you.\r\n- Your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional damage die.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

        "className": "Berserker",
        "text": "Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.\r\n\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Furious Force\r\n_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. \r\n\r\nCasting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.\r\n\r\n### Reckless Power\r\n_**Marauder Approach:** 6th level_\r\nWeapons and the force are equally an extension of your rage. While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n##### Marauder Approach Forcecasting\r\n\r\n### Powerful Presence\r\n_**Marauder Approach:** 10th level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Force Storm\r\n_**Marauder Approach:** 14th level_\r\nYou can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one. ",

Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you hit a creature with the *psychic charge* force power and the target tries to speak, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1), and its voice does not produce sound until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Cloak of Shadows\r\n_**Path of Shadows:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, you can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.\r\n\r\n### Shadow Strike\r\n_**Path of Shadows:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to strike from the shadows.

While you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.\r\n\r\n### Shadow's Wrath\r\n_**Path of Shadows:** 18th level_\r\nYour training has taught you advanced techniques while you maneuver in the shadows. While you are hidden from your target, the first attack roll you make each round does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against your target's Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden. If you are also invisible, you remain invisible.",

The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:\r\n- You can't be disarmed of that weapon while you are conscious. \r\n- If the weapon is within 60 feet of you and you can see it, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon.

As an action, you can telekinetically control your forceblade and have it strike any number of creatures within 10 feet of you, spending 1 force point per target.

Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Remote Healer\r\n_**Physician Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned to deploy medicine from a range. When you use a maneuver targeting an ally that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, that maneuver's range becomes 30 feet.\r\n\r\n### Field Surgeon\r\n_**Physician Pursuit:** 6th and 11th level_\r\nWhenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice.

As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Panacea\r\n_**Physician Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.\r\n\r\nThe target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.\r\n\r\nOnce you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Physician Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Remote Healer\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_\r\nThe range of your Remote Healer feature increases to 60 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Experimental Treatments\r\nYour medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### From the Brink\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nIf the target of your Critical Analysis feature would be reduced to 0 hp, you may use your reaction and end your Critical Analysis feature to have them be reduced to 1 hp instead. Once a creature has benefited from this feature, they must complete a long rest before they can do so again.\r\n\r\n#### Health Advisor\r\nWhenever a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature begins their turn, you can use your reaction to give them temporary hit points equal to one-fourth your scholar level + your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table, which last until the start of their next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Patient Protector\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou can treat creatures within 5 feet of the target of your Critical Analysis feature as if they were also targets of your Critical Analysis.\r\n\r\n#### Surgical Precision\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_ \r\nWhen you hit a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature with a weapon attack, it takes additional damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Tend the Wounded\r\nIf you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d4 extra hit points.\r\n\r\nThis die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n##### Side Effects\r\n\r\n| d20 | Side Effects  |\r\n|:----:|:-------------|\r\n| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |\r\n| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |\r\n| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. The creature gains 1 slowed level. |\r\n| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |\r\n| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |\r\n| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. | \r\n| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|\r\n| 8 | The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead. |\r\n| 9 | The creature gains advantage on perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |\r\n| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|\r\n| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |\r\n| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |\r\n| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |\r\n| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |\r\n| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|\r\n| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |\r\n| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |\r\n| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |\r\n| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |\r\n| 20 | The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree. |",

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.

This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and they must end this movement closer to you than they started.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. \r\n\r\n### Beguiling Presence\r\n_**Politician Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nHumanoids within 60 feet are particularly susceptible to your presence. Humanoids within range have disadvantage on saving throws against any charm or fear effects that originate from you. \r\n\r\n### Politician Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the political world.

The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Placed Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Disarming Shot\r\nYou attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.\r\n\r\n#### Penetrating Shot\r\nYou attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.\r\n\r\nThe damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\r\n\r\n#### Suppressive Shot\r\nYou attempt to pin the target to its location. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n### Head Shot\r\n_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.\r\n\r\n### Distracting Shot\r\n_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.\r\n\r\n### Double Tap\r\n_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no action required). Both attacks can benefit from your Sneak Attack damage, instead of only one.",

They can inspire their allies with renewed vigor while simultaneously protecting them from harm.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half your fighter level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Stay in Formation\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can take the Guard action as a bonus action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Rallying Cry\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three allies within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each ally regains hit points equal to your fighter level.\r\n\r\n##### Shield Specialist Techcasting\r\n\r\nYou can choose an additional ally at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Inspiring Surge\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nWhen you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.\r\n\r\n### Bulwark\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYou can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n### Greater Inspiring Surge\r\n_**Shield Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one, when you using your Inspiring Surge feature.",

Those guardians who focus on Shien/Djem So Form actively attempt to force an opening rather than waiting for the opportunity to present itself.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in heavy armor.\r\n\r\n### Form Basics\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain your choice of the Shien or Djem So lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know the chosen form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.\r\n\r\n### The Way of the Krayt Dragon\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can take a threatening stance for one minute. While in this stance, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain one of the following Channel the Force options. Choose Blade Barrier for Shien or Falling Avalanche for Djem So.\r\n\r\n#### Blade Barrier\r\nOn your turn, when you deal melee weapon damage that includes your Strength modifier, you can forgo your Strength modifier to the damage roll, expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required), and reduce your speed by half. If you do so, energy and kinetic damage you take from weapons before the end of your next turn is reduced by an amount equal to your Strength modifier. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.\r\n\r\n#### Falling Avalanche\r\nOn your turn, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required) and reduce your speed by half to gain advantage on the next ability check or attack roll you make using Strength before the end of your next turn. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.\r\n\r\n### Determination\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 7th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features. Choose Aggressive Negotiations for Shien or Reliable Vigor for Djem So.\r\n\r\n#### Aggressive Negotiations\r\nYou gain proficiency in Intimidation or Persuasion. Additionally, while you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, you can't have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and if the target would make a contested check, they can't have advantage on it.\r\n\r\n#### Reliable Vigor\r\nIf your total for a Strength check or saving throw is less than your guardian level, you can use your guardian level in place of the total.\r\n\r\n### Presence\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 15th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features. Choose Precise Reflection for Shien or Brutal Strikes for Djem So.\r\n\r\n#### Precise Reflection\r\nWhen you hit with an attack made by the *saber reflect* power, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.\r\n\r\n#### Brutal Strikes\r\nThe Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Force-Empowered Strikes or Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.\r\n\r\n### Master of Perseverance\r\n_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 20th level_\r\nYour might overwhelms even the most implacable of foes. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.\r\n- Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you can use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature at 1st-level without expending force points. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.\r\n- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack with advantage against that creature. If the attack hits, you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns it repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.\r\n\r\n### Slayer's Counter\r\n_**Slayer Technique:** 15th level_\r\nIf the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against it. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, you automatically succeed on the saving throw, in addition to the attack's normal effects.",

Those scholars who choose the Tactician Pursuit train themselves and their allies in combat maneuvers to deftly eliminate their foes through clever positioning, and fierce, timely attacks.\r\n\r\n### Battle Display\r\n_**Tactician Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in martial blasters and martial vibroweapons. \r\n\r\n### Tactical Mastery\r\n_**Tactician Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to better command your allies to victory from afar. Your Critical Analysis range is increased to 90 feet. \r\n\r\n### Fire as One\r\n_**Tactician Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYou can focus your target down with the help with an ally. Once per round, whenever the creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature is attacked by someone other than you, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against them. \r\n\r\n### Battlefield Survey\r\n_**Tactician Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYou become a master at leading your allies around in a battlefield you have studied. When you spend 10 minutes observing an area that is within 120 feet from you, or by using a detailed map, select a number of creatures up to your Critical Analysis ability modifier. You and those selected allies ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in that area. \r\n\r\n### All-Out Attack\r\n_**Tactician Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou can use your action to initiate an all-out attack. Choose a number of allies up to your Critical Analysis ability modifier within 60 feet who can see or hear you. The chosen allies may then immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack against a target of your choice. You may choose the target for each attack separately.\r\n\r\nOnce you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Tactician Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your mastery in the field of combat. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Commander's Armor\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in medium armor. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor.\r\n\r\n#### Contingency Plan\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nWhen the target of your Critical Analysis feature scores a critical hit, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to treat the attack as a normal hit instead.\r\n\r\n#### Fighting Style\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Firing Command\r\nYou can take the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you take the Help action to assist an ally attacking the target of your Critical Analysis, it has a range of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Observant Leader\r\nYou have advantage Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\n#### Studied Commander\r\nWhen you make an Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Technology) check related to battles, tactics, or weaponry, you may expend a superiority die and add it to the roll.\r\n\r\n#### Tactical Retreat\r\nWhen you take the Dash action, opportunity attacks made against you are made at disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Unbound Commander\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level_\r\nYou learn to command your allies to victory from afar.

        "text": "Those engineers who choose the Unstable Engineering discipline create and use untested combinations, resulting in powerful�and often unpredictable�effects.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in your choice of artisan's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with tinker's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.\r\n\r\n### Modified Tinkercannon\r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd, 9th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to enhance your tinker's implements with unstable science, modifying them into a harness with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your tinker's implements to create a tinkercannon. You must have tinker's implements in order to perform this modification.\r\n\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinkercannon, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table to create a random effect. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, your tinkercannon come equipped with four overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you trigger an Unstable Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and each time you do so in excess of your proficiency bonus (resetting on a long rest) your maximum tech points is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended overrides when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Unstable Volley\r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 3rd, 9th, and 17th level_\r\nWhile wielding your tinkercannon, as a bonus action you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to launch a volley of unstable energy at a surface located within 30 feet of you that you can see. This energy adheres to the surface for 1 minute, after which it erupts. As a part of this bonus action, or as a bonus action on a following turn, you can cause the energy to erupt early. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successfu one. \r\n\r\nThe range at which you can launch your volley increases to 60 feet at 9th level, and 120 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\nThis damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Creative Destruction\r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 6th level_\r\nYou can add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that don't already include that modifier. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Overrides \r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 14th level_\r\nYou gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.\r\n\r\n### Engineering Bombardment\r\n_**Unstable Engineering:** 18th level_\r\nThe harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.\r\n\r\n##### Unstable Engineering Surge\r\n\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|01-02|Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for 1 minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.\t|\r\n|03-04|For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.\t|\r\n|05-06|A DRK-1 tracker droid appears with 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.|\r\n|07-08|You cast *explosion* at 3rd-level centered on yourself without expending tech points.|\r\n|09-10|You cast *homing rockets* at 5th-level without expending tech points.|\r\n|11-12|Roll a d10.

        "text": "For some berserkers, it is their duty or birthright to lead their tribe and kin to battle and victory. The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.\r\n\r\n### Savage Diplomat\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYour path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.\r\n\r\n### Commanding Rage\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Inspiring Presence\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage, choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n### Raid Planning\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to their next initiative roll, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.\r\n\r\n### War Chant\r\n_**Warchief Approach:** 14th level_\r\nYou have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.",

They bend the Force to shield their allies and expose their foes.\r\n\r\n### Force Barrier\r\n_**Way of Balance:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can weave the Force around yourself for protection. When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).\r\n\r\nWhenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.\r\n\r\nWhile the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.\r\n\r\nOnce you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Projected Barrier\r\n_**Way of Balance:** 6th level_\r\nWhen a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Force Barrier to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.\r\n\r\n### At-Will Barrier\r\n_**Way of Balance:** 10th level_\r\nYour at-will universal powers grant a small boost to your Force Barrier. When you cast an at-will universal power, the barrier regains 1 hit point. You can't restore your barrier above half its maximum hit points in this way.\r\n\r\n### Improved Suppression\r\n_**Way of Balance:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you cast a force power that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that power, such as *sever force* or *force suppression*, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.\r\n\r\n### Force Resistance\r\n_**Way of Balance:** 18th level_\r\nYou have advantage on saving throws against force powers.

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes *shocked* until the end of their next turn.

When you cast a force power of 1st through 6th level that deals lightning damage, you can deal maximum damage with that power.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature with no adverse effects a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table.

Those consulars who follow the Way of Suggestion have honed their attunement to the Force, allowing them to disappear, despite being in plain sight.\r\n\r\n### Subtle Control\r\n_**Way of Suggestion:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can befuddle a creature's mind with nothing but a gesture. As an action, you can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you can force the creature to believe or forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation or encounter it had that you were present for in the past 10 minutes.

On a failed save, you become invisible to that creature for 1 minute, or until you deal damage to it.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Delicate Potency\r\n_**Way of Suggestion:** 10th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYour mind-affecting powers are particularly potent. When you cast one of *cloud mind*, *dominate mind*, *mass coerce mind*, and *dominate monster*, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level.

If you do so, the power immediately takes effect at the start of your turn, after the specified number of rounds have passed.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Subtle Presence\r\n_**Way of Suggestion:** 18th level_\r\nYou've learned how to weave the Force around you in a cloak of your choice. As an action, you can focus the Force for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain your choice of one of the following effects. \r\n\r\nYou can use each feature once. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Cloak of Fright\r\nEach creature of your choice that is within 60 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. \r\n\r\n#### Cloak of Invisibility\r\nYou and everything you are wearing or carrying become invisible to creatures of your choice. If you damage a creature or affect it with a force power, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a success, you are no longer invisible to that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Cloak of Memory\r\nCreatures that see you or any allies within 30 feet of you during this time cannot recall your physical appearances, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.\r\n\r\nCreatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC once the interaction ends.

At 18th level, when you do so, your speed increases by an additional 10 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the fighter table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Whirling Weapons\r\n_**Adept Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYour constant blur of motion and attacks becomes an unending barrage as you build momentum. Once on your turn when you miss with a weapon attack you can make another weapon attack, no action required. \r\n\r\n### Focused Breathing\r\n_**Adept Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn to recover some of your expended power quickly. When you use your Second Wind you also regain a number of force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of one). \r\n\r\n### Unstoppable Force\r\n_**Adept Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYou learn to completely ignore many of the most devastating impediments of combat. You can expend a use of Indomitable to gain the effect of the *freedom of movement* force power until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n### Instant Acceleration\r\n_**Adept Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou reach the pinnacle of your training, moving faster than eyes or most sensors can track. When you use Action Surge feature, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can teleport before or after the additional action.",

See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your monk level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Flow-Walking\r\n_**Aing-Tii Order:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou can cast the *phasestrike* force power without expending force points. When you reach 11th level, the damage bonus of the special attack made during *phasestrike* increases to 2d8, and at 17th level it increases to 3d8.\r\n\r\n##### Aing-Tii Order Forcecasting\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use your action to cast an at-will force power, you can use your Martial Arts or Focus features.\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Prismatic Step\r\n_**Aing-Tii Order:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you take the Attack action, you can teleport up to 10 feet before each attack to an unoccupied space you can see.\r\n\r\nIf you attack at least two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack against a third creature (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Iridescent Strikes\r\n_**Aing-Tii Order:** 17th level_\r\nWhen you use your action to cast a force power, you can spend 2 focus points to teleport to a space within 5 feet of a creature affected by the power and make two unarmed strikes against that creature as a bonus action.",

        "text": "Aqinos Form, also know as Adaptation Form, is named after a Jedi Master who sought to merge technology with Force use. Those guardians who focus on Aqinos Form adopt these tenets to employ clever exploits using technology and the aid of a droid companion.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in astrotech's implements and the Technology skill.\r\n\r\n### Form Basics\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the Aqinos lightsaber form, detailed in the Lightsaber Forms section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form. \r\n\r\n### Techcasting Secrets\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned to blend your technological aptitude with the Force. Choose two tech powers of no higher level than your Max Power Level, as shown in the guardian table. The chosen powers count as both universal force powers and tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the guardian table.\r\n\r\nYou learn two additional powers at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher level than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n### Droid Companion\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create, customize, and bond with your own droid companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.\r\n\r\nIf your companion is irreparably destroyed, or you want a companion, you must first break the bond with your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your droid companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your companion is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.\r\n- Your companion gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each companion trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of companion traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nLastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your companion can cast the tech powers you know without expending tech points. If your companion casts an at-will power in this way, it does not scale normally at higher levels. Instead, if it would scale at 5th level, it instead scales at 11th level, and if it would scale at 11th level, it instead scales at 17th level. If your companion casts a power of 2nd-level or higher, it consumes a number of uses of this feature equal to that power's level.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, your droid companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your droid companion must be within 60 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the guardian table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn your choice of the Cause Harm or Lend Aid Channel the Force options, and when you use either of these options, you gain additional benefits.\r\n\r\n#### Cause Harm\r\nYou can choose to deal ion damage instead of necrotic.\r\n\r\n#### Lend Aid\r\nDroids and constructs are now valid targets.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Calibration\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, or you restore hit points to a friendly creature that is at 0 hit points with a tech power, you regain an expended use of your Channel the Force, and you gain temporary force points equal to the power's level.\r\n\r\n### Master of Adaptation\r\n_**Aqinos Form:** 20th level_\r\nYour masteries of the Force and technology have achieved equilibrium. Your Constitution and Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have resistance to ion damage, and you can't have disadvantage on saving throws against ion or lightning damage.\r\n- You can't have disadvantage on attack rolls you make as a part of a tech power, and enemies can't have advantage on saving throws against your tech powers.\r\n- You add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage or healing you do with tech powers you cast that don't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\nWhile you are conscious and your droid is within 60 feet of you and conscious, it also gains these benefits.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

        "name": "Archaeologist Pursuit",
        "className": "Scholar",
        "text": "\r\nArchaeologists are those who study the remnants of historical civilizations. Those scholars who choose the Archaeologist Pursuit are driven by a desire to uncover the past, forming a connection to the lives of those that came before, and unlocking within themselves a connection not just to history, but to the Force itself.\r\n\r\n### Studious Excavator\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with archaeologist kits and in the Lore skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned powers from your studies of civilizations that were also once close to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your scholar level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table, + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Intelligence or Wisdom for light side powers (your choice), Intelligence or Charisma for dark side powers (your choice), and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n##### Archaeologist Pursuit Forcecasting\r\n\r\n### Archaic Diagnostics\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you analyze a hostile creature, you can use maneuvers that require a weapon attack when you cast a force power that requires a force attack and you can use maneuvers that require a hit with a weapon attack when a creature fails a saving throw against a force power you cast.\r\n\r\n### Force Carving\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYou have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\r\n\r\n### Psychometric Analysis\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYour strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination. For example, touching the rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An object �questioned� in this way can only provide information relating to its past. The GM has the final say on what objects can be questioned, and to what extent.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Knowledge is Power\r\n_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to steal the knowledge of how to cast a power from another forcecaster. When a hostile creature casts a force power that affects a friendly creature within range of your Critical Analysis feature, and you use your reaction target that friendly creature with your Critical Analysis feature, you can force the creature casting the power to make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice) against your universal force save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.\r\n\r\nOn a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and you steal the knowledge of that power if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast. For the next 8 hours, you know the power and can cast it using your force points. The creature cannot cast that power again until the 8 hours have passed.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Archaeologist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies into historical civilations. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Archive Research\r\nYour expeditions have turned up a bevy of knowledge on the force. You learn three at-will force powers of your choice, which don't count against your number of force powers known.\r\n\r\n#### Force Combat Knowledge\r\nYour research into Jedi and Sith combat techniques has allowed you to gain proficiency in simple lightweapons. Additionally, you gain knowledge of one lightsaber form of your choice.\r\n\r\n#### It Belongs in a Museum\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYour knowledge of antiquities is unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Lore) check or an ability check with your archaeologist kit, you may treat any roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.\r\n\r\n#### Localized Survey\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nYour affinity for the force allows you to key in to the recent past of an area you enter. When you would expend a use of your Psychometric Analysis, you can instead choose to target your immediate vicinity (up to a 50-foot cube) and investigate for at least 1 minute. For each minute you investigate, you see visions of recent events in the area going back a number of days equal to your scholar level, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. \r\n\r\nYou can investigate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your scholar level and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were concentrating on a power. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Making This Up As You Go\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 17th level_\r\nYou may now cast force powers at 4th-level twice between rests. \r\n\r\n#### Telekinetic Ministrations\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou can cast the *telekinesis* force power at 5th level without spending force points.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### The Years and the Mileage\r\nYour archaeological studies have taken you all across the galaxy. While you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can use your universal forcecasting ability instead of Wisdom when making Insight or Survival checks.\r\n\r\n#### Tomb of the Ancients\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nAs a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in the Force until the end of your next turn. For the duration, you have resistance to the triggering damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your universal forcecasting ability modifier + your scholar level to potentially absorb the attack, and your speed is reduced to 0.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

        "text": "\r\nMany berserkers forgo armor and rely on their own fortitude. Berserkers of the Armored Approach, however, embrace the use of armor. Each one customizes their own suit of armor to be used both defensively and offensively, so that the suit becomes an extension of the berserker's own might and fury.\r\n\r\n### Spiked Armor\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in armormech's implements. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize a suit of light or medium armor into spiked armor. You must have the armor and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. You can only have one suit of spiked armor at a time.\r\n\r\nThis armor gains the barbed (1d4) property. If the armor already has the barbed property, the barbed damage increases by one step (from d4 to d6, or from d6 to d8). Additionally, while raging, you add your rage damage bonus to your barbed damage when you successfully initiate or maintain a grapple.\r\n\r\nWhile wearing your spiked armor, you can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you can use your spiked armor as an improvised weapon. When you do so, you are considered proficient with it, and if your armor's barbed damage would be higher than your damage with improvised weapons, you use the barbed damage instead. If you take the Attack action on your turn and make at least one attack with your spiked armor, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with your spiked armor against the same target.\r\n\r\n### Environmental Shielding\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou customize your spiked armor to better protect you. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. While wearing your spiked armor, you have resistance to damage of the chosen type. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different damage type, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat or cold.\r\n\r\n### Customized Armor\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn new ways to customize your spiked armor. Choose one of the following options. While wearing your spiked armor, you gain the effects of the chosen option. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different option, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.\r\n\r\n#### Defensive Field\r\nOn your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your berserker level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Deflective Layer\r\nYour armor class increases by 1.\r\n\r\n#### Grappling Line\r\nYou can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, it takes kinetic damage from your armor spikes equal to your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Integrated Sonar\r\nYou can use an action to give yourself the benefits of the *true sight* force power for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Neural Interface\r\nYou are immune to all effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.\r\n\r\n### Spiked Retribution\r\n_**Armored Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier, as long as you are wearing your spiked armor and you aren't incapacitated.\r\n\r\nIf you are raging, you add your rage damage bonus to this damage.",

        "text": "Those engineers who choose the Artificer Engineering discipline focus on building and modifying lightsabers, while tapping into the latent presence of the Force in these lightsaber crystals.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in artificer's implements, and with the lightsaber simple lightweapon. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with artificer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.\r\n\r\n### Modified Lightsaber\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 3rd and 9th level_\r\nYou learn to modify an unenhanced lightsaber utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightsaber. You must have the lightsaber and artificer's implements in order to perform this modification.\r\n\r\nYour modified lightsaber is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightsaber has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nSome modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nAt 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightsabers. The total modification slots are split across the two items.\r\n\r\n### Force Resonance\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nOnce per round, when you hit a creature with your modified lightsaber, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as your modified lightsaber's damage.\r\n\r\nThe damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Forcecasting Secrets\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYour study of kyber crystals has awakened a latent force sensitivity. Choose two force powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the engineer table.\r\n\r\nAt 7th level, you learn two additional force powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of the same level.\r\n\r\n### Disruptive Resonance\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you hit a creature that is concentrating on a power with your modified lightsaber, the creature has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature immediately takes psychic damage equal to your engineer level + your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n### Resonating Recovery\r\n_**Artificer Engineering:** 18th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain a use of your Potent Aptitude. Your number of Potent Aptitude uses can not exceed your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n### Artificer Modifications\r\nIf a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.\r\n\r\n#### Additonal Beam Port\r\nYou install a second beam port into your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the double (1d8) property. You can only benefit from this property while wielding your modified lightsaber with two hands.\r\n\r\n#### Adegan Crystal\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Blastsaber \r\n_**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Prototype Blastsaber_\r\nYou further fine tune your blastsaber. As an action, you can disable a single electronic device not being worn or held by another creature within 5 feet of you. The device is then disabled until it is rebooted.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you create a projected barrier of ion energy in a 10-foot-radius sphere around you until the start of your next turn. Hostile creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. When a hostile creature enters the shielded area or starts its turn there, that creature takes 3d4 ion damage. Any electronics not being worn or held within the barrier's radius are disabled until rebooted.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Brightsaber \r\n_**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Prototype Brightsaber_\r\nYou further fine tune your brightsaber. While activated, your modified lightsaber's bright light now automatically dispels illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to blind your target, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Disruptorsaber\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 15th level, Prototype Disruptorsaber_\r\nYou further fine tune your disruptorsaber. While activated, your modified lightsaber lightly obscures the area within 5 feet of it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to knock your target prone, the next saving throw you make before the end of your next turn has advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Barrier \r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nOn your turn, when you make an attack roll with your modified lightsaber, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you do, you can use your reaction to erect a temporary barrier that lasts until the start of your next turn. While the barrier is activated, you have a bonus to AC against the first attack roll made against you equal to your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Beam Gem Lens\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Biometric Safety Measures\r\nA security system is installed into the hilt of your lightweapon. When a creature other than you attempts to activate your lightweapon, the activation fails. Additionally, the creature attempting to activate must make on a Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to engineer level, and become shocked until the start of its next turn. On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not shocked. Regardless of success or failure, the creature drops your modified lightsaber.\r\n\r\n#### Blastsaber Conversion\r\n_Incompatible with other conversions_\r\nYou heavily modify your lightweapon to allow you to make a ranged weapon attack. With this modification, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d6 energy damage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to ion. \r\n\r\nYou can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Brightsaber Conversion\r\n_Incompatible with other conversions_\r\nYou modify your lightweapon, giving it a brighter glow. While activated, your modified lightsaber sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to fire.\r\n\r\nYou can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Burn Through\r\nWhen you score a critical hit with your modified lightsaber, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Comfortable Handle\r\nYou make minor modifications to the ergonomics of your modified saber's hilt. Your modified lightsaber gains the finesse property.\r\n\r\n#### Crossguard\r\nYou add an energy guard at the base of your modified lightsaber's blade. While wielding your modified lightsaber, you gain a +1 bonus to your armor class against melee weapon attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Disruptorsaber Conversion\r\n_Incompatible with other conversions_\r\nYou modify your lightweapon, causing it to eminate a sickly green light. Your modified lightsaber loses the luminous property.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to acid.\r\n\r\nYou can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Extended Beam\r\nYou install a series of beam focusing amplifiers into your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the reach property.\r\n\r\n#### Greatsaber Array\r\nYou augment the configuration of your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the two-handed property, and it's damage die increases to 1d12.\r\n\r\n#### Intense Beam\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level, Burn Through_\r\nYour modified lightsaber's critical hit range increases by 1.\r\n\r\n#### Magnetic-Lock Grip\r\nYou insert a series of magnetically charged grips into your modified lightsaber's hilt. While wielding your modified lightsaber, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to disarm or avoid being disarmed.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype Blastsaber \r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level, Blastsaber Conversion_\r\nYou fine tune your blastsaber. When you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you can use your bonus action to cause your modified lightsaber to let loose a burst of energy. Creatures other than yourself within 5 feet of the target creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take ion damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype Brightsaber \r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level, Brightsaber Conversion_\r\nYou fine tune your brightsaber. When you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to blind the target of the attack. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded. \r\n\r\n#### Prototype Disruptorsaber\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level, Disruptorsaber Conversion_\r\nYou fine tune your disruptorsaber. When you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to knock the target of your attack prone. The creature must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n\r\n#### Returning Weapon\r\nYou install a retractible chain in the hilt of your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the thrown property with a range of 20/60, and when you throw the weapon, it immediately returns to your hand.",

        "text": "\r\nSome scouts choose to navigate around defenses, while others choose to go through them. Followers of the Artillerist Technique learn to exert greater control of their tech powers, causing delayed�and often empowered�effects.\r\n\r\n### Modular Munitions\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you cast a tech power, rather than having it take effect instantly, you can choose to delay the effect to occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). When you do so, any creature that leaves the affected area of your tech power is unaffected when the tech power occurs. If the power would only target one creature, and that creature moves from the space it was in when you cast the power, the tech power automatically misses if it would call for an attack roll, as if you had rolled a 1 on the attack, and the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the power if it calls for a saving throw, as if it had rolled a 20 on the save.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you cast a tech power and choose to delay it in this way, and that tech power would deal damage, you can apply one of the following additional empowerment effects:\r\n- **Flashbang**: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.\r\n- **Mire:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain one slowed level until the start of your next turn.\r\n- **Psyche:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nIf an empowerment effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 tech point to use it. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Artillerist\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd and 11th level_\r\nYou can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 10-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, and when a creature is hit by a tech attack or fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can apply your Ranger's Quarry damage to that creature.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, you can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 15-foot cube area, instead of a 10-foot cube.\r\n\r\n### Sundered Defenses\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYour precise bombardments make even the most hardened defenses crumble. When you cast a power that calls for a tech attack or a Dexterity saving throw, it reduces partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against creatures affected by it. If an affected creature has one-quarter cover, your power ignores it entirely.\r\n\r\n### Target Masking\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. \r\n\r\nAs a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Master of Ordnance\r\n_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:\r\n- **Confusion:** Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.\r\n- **Knockout:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n- **Static:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you would spend 1 tech point to apply an empowerment effect, it no longer reduces your maximum tech points.",

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with audiotech�s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.\r\n\r\n### Modified Instrument\r\n_**Audiotech Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to modify an instrument utilizing your audiotech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify an instrument. You must have the instrument and audiotech's implements in order to perform this modification.\r\n\r\nYour modified instrument is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified instrument has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nSome modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.\r\n\r\n### Potent Amplitude\r\n_**Audiotech Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nAs an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin performing an enhanced song, which lasts for 1 minute. While playing a song, you gain access to a new use for your Potent Aptitude, as determined by the song, listed below. You can end your song at any time, no action required.\r\n\r\nWhenever you take damage while playing your song, you must make a Constitution saving throw to continue playing. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, which number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, you must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a damage dealing tech power while playing your song that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal sonic damage. If you do so, instead of an attack roll or saving throw, the power instead requires a Constitution saving throw.\r\n\r\nYour song ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you are no longer holding your modified instrument.\r\n\r\nYou can initiate playing an enhanced song twice. You regain all expended songs when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Song of Battle\r\nWhen an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you deals damage to a creature, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to the damage dealt.\r\n\r\n#### Song of Support\r\nWhen an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw against a harmful effect, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to their saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Song of Disruption\r\nWhen an enemy within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, subtracting the result of the die from their saving throw.\r\n\r\n### Concussive Blast\r\n_**Audiotech Engineering:** 6th level_\r\nYou add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that deal sonic damage.\r\n\r\n### Smooth Rhythm\r\n_**Audiotech Engineering:** 14th level_\r\nWhenever you use your Potent Aptitude while your playing an enhanced song, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Potent Aptitude Dice.\r\n\r\n### Legendary Coda\r\n_**Audiotech Engineering:** 18th level_\r\nYou've gained mastery over your modified instrument. As an action, you can end your enhanced song in a triumphant blast of power with an effect determined by the song you are playing.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Battle Crescendo\r\nChoose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 sonic damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 turns. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned. If a creature is killed by this power, its head explodes.\r\n\r\n#### Support Crescendo\r\nChoose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Once in the next minute, each creature can, as a free action in response to taking damage, choose to halve that damage. Additionally, if the damage would reduce them to 0 hit points, they are instead reduced to 1.\r\n\r\n#### Disruption Crescendo\r\nChoose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 turns.

On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers or features on your next turn.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Finding My Way\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Rush_\r\nWhile you are playing an enhanced song, when a creature makes a melee attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the roll. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the engineer table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Hypnotic Melody\r\nAs an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin to play a song woven with subtle hypnotic influence. Choose a number of creature up to your Intelligence modifier. If those creatures listen to this song for a full minute, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are not aware that you attempted to influence them, nor are creatures that failed their saving throw once the power ends.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Inaudible Casting\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level, Simple Melodies_\r\nWhen you cast a tech power or make use of a feature that requires playing your modified instrument, you can choose to do so quietly.

This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.\r\n\r\n#### Overwhelming Soundwaves\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 15th level_\r\nWhile playing, creatures of your choice treat a 15-foot-radius sphere around you as difficult terrain. Additionally, as an action, you can cause each affected creature to make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 sonic damage on a failed save.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype Battle Enhancement\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Battle Song Enhancement_\r\nWhile playing your Song of Battle, when you cast a tech power or use a class feature that affects other creatures within the radius of your song, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use your Battle Song Enhancement feature, you create a third burst.\r\n\r\n#### Prototype Disruption Enhancement\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level, Disruption Song Enhancement_\r\nWhile playing your Song of Disruption, when a creature you can see that can hear you attempts to cast a power, you can use your reaction to cast the *tech override* power at 3rd level.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Sonar Pulse\r\nAs an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can release a wave of sound that provides feedback on your surroundings. For the next minute, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to search for hidden doors, traps, or invisible creatures.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Song Flow\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_\r\nWhile playing an enhanced song, you can use your bonus action to change from one song to another.\r\n\r\n#### Support Song Enhancement\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nWhile playing your Song of Support, when you cast a tech power that restores hit points or grants temporary hit points, the amount restored or granted is increased by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n#### Weapon Integration\r\nYou can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your instrument.

You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Change Up\r\nYou can use your object interaction and expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting to change the Fighting Style option granted to you by your fighter class feature.\r\n\r\n#### Draw\r\nWhen you use your object interaction to draw one or more weapons, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to increase your critical hit range by 1 with the weapon(s) until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Stow\r\nWhen you use your object interaction to stow a weapon, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to take the Disengage action.\r\n\r\n### Dervish\r\n_**Blademaster Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you regain an expended use of your Adaptive Fighting.\r\n\r\n### Resilient Fighting\r\n_**Blademaster Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nWhen you expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting, you gain resistance to energy and kinetic damage dealt by weapons until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Adrenaline Rush\r\n_**Blademaster Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you use your Action Surge feature, you can take an extra bonus action on top of the additional action.\r\n\r\n### Bladestorm\r\n_**Blademaster Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou can use your action to make a single melee weapon attack against each creature within your reach.

A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.\r\n\r\n### Furious Throw\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYour throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. When you throw a weapon with which you are proficient, you can benefit from your class features that only apply to melee weapon attacks, such as Rage or Reckless Attack.\r\n\r\n### Returning Attacks\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nAny weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.\r\n\r\n### Throw Anything\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).\r\n\r\n### Fling People\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may immediately throw the creature.\r\n\r\n#### Throw Friend\r\nIf the creature is a willing ally and volunteers to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature may immediately use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack, adding your Strength modifier to the attack's damage roll.\r\n\r\n#### Throw Foe\r\nIf the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.\r\n\r\n### Raging Whirlwind\r\n_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 14th level_\r\nYou can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you (no action required) or your rage ends.",

They must end this movement within 30 feet of you.\r\n- **Disengage:** The creature can move up to 5 feet. If this movement would provoke an opportunity attack, the opportunity attack is made with disadvantage.\r\n- **Hide:** The creature has advantage on the first attack roll they make before the end of their next turn against a creature you successfully hide from.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the operative table.

The condition immediately ends on that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Bolstering Strike\r\nYou choose a friendly creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you.

Those creatures may add their proficiency to any Dexterity (Stealth) checks they make as long as they remain within 60 feet of you and they do not already add their proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, each ally other than you that surprises a creature and hits it with an attack on their first turn in combat rolls two dice equal to the size of your Sneak Attack dice, dealing additional damage of the same type to the creature. \r\n\r\n### Squad Goals\r\n_**Bolstering Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou have such skill at maintaining the faith of your allies that the very sight of you in danger can spur them into action.

Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).\r\n\r\n### Reckless Strikes\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.\r\n\r\nSome of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table.

On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Staggering Strike\r\nYour target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.\r\n\r\n### Shattering Strikes\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYour rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials.

While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.\r\n\r\n### Enforcer\r\n_**Brawling Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage.

Those scholars who choose the Chef Pursuit know the importance and power that food carries.\r\n\r\n### Culinary Knowledge\r\n_**Chef Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with chef's kits and your choice of the Nature or Survival skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Emergency Supplements\r\n_**Chef Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou are prepared to assist allies with specially prepared, instantly effective supplements. When an ally is the target of your Critical Analysis feature and within 5 feet of you, you may expend a superiority die and give that ally the benefits of any discovery that utilizes a superiority die and is exclusive to the Chef Pursuit, regardless of whether or not you've chosen it. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Balanced Diet\r\n_**Chef Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYour cooking is so nutritionally balanced that it allows allies to stave off the effects of continued rigorous activity. Creatures of your choice who eat food prepared by you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion, as described in chapter 8, until the end of their next long rest.\r\n\r\n### Comfort Food\r\n_**Chef Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nIf you or any friendly creatures who have consumed food you prepared during a short rest regain hit points by spending hit dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d8 hit points.\r\n\r\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.\r\n\r\n### Heroes' Feast\r\n_**Chef Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou have developed a signature feast that is the purest distillation of your knowledge and talent as a chef.\r\n\r\nOver the course of a long rest, you can expend rare culinary supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your feast, which can feed a number of creatures equal to twice your Critical Analysis ability modifer.

This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n### Chef Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the culinary arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Allergens\r\nAs a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it an irritating allergen. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts half the result of your superiority die (minimum of one) from the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throws it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative Fuel\r\nAny of your chef features, maneuvers, or discoveries can now affect droids and constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Banquet\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 17th level, Full Course_\r\nOver the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of four).\r\n\r\n#### Brain Food\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary force or tech points (their choice) equal to the number you roll on the superiority die. When an affected creature casts a force or tech power, the temporary force or tech points are spent first. An affected target can only benefit from one source of temporary force or tech points at a time, and they last until they're depleted or until the affected target completes their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Debilitants\r\nAs a bonus action when preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a subtle poison. Any creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice the number rolled on your superiority die + your maneuver modifier. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Energizers\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature has their walking speed increased by 10 until the end of their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancers\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to a damage roll that would affect only one target. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Filling Meal\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nOver the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize up to two different maneuvers from this archetype, rather than one.\r\n\r\n#### Full Course\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level, Filling Meal_\r\nOver the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of three).\r\n\r\n#### Health Food\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the number you roll on the superiority die. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Muscle Relaxants\r\nAs a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a fast acting muscle relaxant. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts the result of your superiority die from the first damage roll it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### On the Rocks\r\nAny food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional cooling effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes fire damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.\r\n\r\n#### Secret Ingredient\r\nIf you or any friendly creature that has consumed food made by you during their last short or long rest gains temporary hit points, the number of temporary hit points they gain increases by an amount equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifer.\r\n\r\n#### Spice of Life\r\nAny food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional warming effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes cold damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.\r\n\r\n#### Supplements\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.\r\n\r\n#### Vitamins\r\nAt the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws until the end of their next short or long rest. If a creature was already proficient in Constitution saving throws, they instead become proficient in a saving throw of your choice. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.",

While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.\r\n\r\nAs an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).\r\n\r\nYou can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Bridge\r\nYou deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n#### Cage\r\nYou create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. \r\n\r\n#### Shelter\r\nYou erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.\r\n\r\n#### Tower\r\nYou erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\n#### Wall\r\nYou deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. \r\n\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.\r\n\r\n### Potent Fortifications\r\n_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack. When you do so, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level.\r\n\r\n### Build and Destroy\r\n_**Construction Engineering:** 6th level_\r\nYou've learned how to manipulate the weak points in structures with your technology. Your tech powers and weapon attacks gain the siege property, and your portable structures have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage dealt by weapons.\r\n\r\n### Structural Knowledge\r\n_**Construction Engineering:** 14th level_\r\nYou can spend 1 hour inspecting and looking over a structure you can see from every angle available to you and comparing it to data you have on hand. At the end of the hour, you learn the basic blueprints for the structure, including but not limited to:\r\n- The structure's total hit points.\r\n- Any common materials that make up the structures.\r\n- Whether or not the structure is in use or abandoned.\r\n- The total floor count for the structure, as well as the general purpose of each floor if it was created to suit a specific purpose.\r\n- All non-secret entrances (including doors, windows, vents, pipe systems) and where you could find them.\r\n- A basic map-layout of every floor and ventilation system for the building.\r\n- The history of the building such as what company or species could have constructed it, as well as how long it's been built.\r\n- Any structural weak points it might have.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make an Investigation check while searching this structure for hidden structural elements, such as doors or passages, if you have constructor's implements, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\r\n\r\n### Master Builder\r\n_**Construction Engineering:** 18th level_\r\nYour ability with your portable structures has reached untold superiority. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- You can have two structures active at a time, instead of only one, as you learn to more efficiently use your portable structure.\r\n- Your structures no longer take double damage from the siege property.\r\n- Your structures no longer automatically fail Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Instead, your structure adds your proficiency bonus to the d20 roll when it makes one of these saving throws.",

A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Deadeye\r\n_**Deadeye Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nThe range of your Ranger's Quarry feature doubles. Additionally, when making ranged weapon attacks against the target of your Ranger's Quarry, the normal and long range of your blaster weapons double.\r\n\r\n### Cover to Cover\r\n_**Deadeye Technique:** 7th level_\r\nAttack rolls made against you on your turn are made with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n##### Deadeye Technique Focused Superiority\r\n\r\n### Shoot First\r\n_**Deadeye Technique:** 11th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once. Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type as the weapon. This damage increases to 1d10 at 13th level and 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Overwatch\r\n_**Deadeye Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou have become a master at protecting your allies from afar. When a creature attempts to make an opportunity attack against an allied creature, or forces your ally to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make an attack roll against the enemy creature. \r\n\r\nIf your attack hits, either impose disadvantage on the enemy creature's opportunity attack roll or grant advantage to any allies making the saving throw.",

They have an explosive for every situation, whether it be breaching a fortified bunker, taking down a walker, or simply demonstrating that in combat, standing too close to your squadmates can be fatal.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in demolitions kit. Additionally, when you would install a breaching charge, you can do so in half the time.\r\n\r\n### Explosive Charge\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd, 7th, and 15th level_\r\nYou learn to create a number of small explosives known as charges. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these charges. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nOnce per turn, when you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a charge at a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). A creature takes 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. \r\n\r\nThe damage of your charges increases to 3d4 at 7th level and 4d4 at 15th level.\r\n\r\n### Cause and Effect\r\n_**Demolitions Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to throw grenades as a bonus action.

        "text": "Those operatives who choose the Disabling Practice utilize a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts, and joint locks to immobilize their opponent. They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.\r\n\r\n### Clinch Strike\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:\r\n- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8), and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage when you hit with an unarmed strike even if it doesn't have the finesse property.\r\n- You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.\r\n- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.\r\n\r\n### Skilled Grappler\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.\r\n\r\nSome of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Constrict\r\nYou attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.  \r\n\r\nIf you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.\r\n\r\n#### Disarm\r\nYou attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.\r\n\r\n#### Hip Toss\r\nYou attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.\r\n\r\n### Human Shield\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.\r\n\r\n### Kiss the Wall\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.\r\n\r\n### Neck Snap\r\n_**Disabling Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes 10d10 true damage. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.",

        "text": "Those fighters who choose to become Enhancement Specialists learn to apply their technological prowess to their blasters. With their deep understanding of both their weapon and how to manipulate its ammunition on the fly, they can often turn the tides of a battle with a single shot.\r\n\r\n### Studied Shooter\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the *encrypted message* or *minor hologram* tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.  \r\n\r\n### Special Ammunition\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.\r\n\r\n#### Ammunition Enhancements\r\nYou know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under \"Ammunition Enhancements\" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,\r\n\r\nYou gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Amplified Shots\r\nYou have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Saving Throws\r\nSome of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Ammunition save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Ammunition Enhancements\r\nThe ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Carbonite Shot\r\nWhen this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.\r\n\r\nThe cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Coercing Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.\r\n\r\nThe poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Explosive Shot\r\nYou fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.\r\n\r\nThe fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Hallucinogen Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThe psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Piercing Shot\r\nYou enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.\r\n\r\nThe extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Quell Shot\r\nYou fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nThe poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n#### Seeking Shot\r\nYou apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.\r\n\r\nThe kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.\r\n\r\n### Redirected Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.\r\n\r\n### Ever-Ready Shot\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYour enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.\r\n\r\n### Ammunition Upgrades\r\n_**Enhancement Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYour ammunition enhancements improve.",

This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.

You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, and when a creature ends your Critical Analysis feature on themself, it does not end this effect for other creatures in your Surveyed Area. \r\n\r\n### Field Advantage\r\n_**Explorer Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYou learn to quickly convey spatial information in the midst of combat about the area you analyzed, giving them an edge at maneuvering in the area. While moving through your Surveyed Area, you and friendly creatures of your choice ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and opportunity attacks against them are made with disadvantage.\r\n\r\n### Unstoppable Adventurer\r\n_**Explorer Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYou learn to swim and scale vertical surfaces with ease. You gain swimming and climbing speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your Sage Advice feature can be used to give friendly creatures knowledge on how to swim or climb, provided you have a swimming or climbing speed. Chosen creatures have a swimming speed or climbing speed for the entire duration.\r\n\r\n### Survey Master\r\n_**Explorer Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nWhen you use the Surveyed Area feature, the area affected is a 30-foot cube instead of a 15-foot cube.\r\n\r\n### Explorer Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in maps and hidden routes. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Cover Adept\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 12th level_\r\nYou treat one-quarter cover as half cover, half cover as three-quarters cover, and three-quarters cover as full cover. Additionally, while you are in cover, Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make gain a bonus equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n#### Dungeon Explorer\r\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to locate any secret doors or traps, and you have resistance to damage dealt by traps.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can use your Sage Advice feature to teach friendly creatures about various types of traps, following the same rules of that feature. When you do so, the chosen creatures have resistance to damage dealt by traps.\r\n\r\n#### Galactic Explorer\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nWhen you make an Intelligence (Piloting) check and add your proficiency bonus to the check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10. \r\n\r\n#### Grappling Hunter\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nAttack rolls that you make against creatures that you are grappling have advantage. \r\n\r\n#### High Ground\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you or a friendly creature hits a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature, it takes additional damage equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1). \r\n\r\n#### No Stone Left Unturned\r\nWhen you make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a hidden creature that is inside the area that is targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you do so with advantage. \r\n\r\n#### Versatile Explorer\r\nYou can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.",

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Indomitable in Tandem\r\n_**Fireteam Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you and your companion are both forced to make a saving throw against the same effect, and one�but not both�of you fails, you can expend a use of your Indomitable feature to instead have you both succeed.\r\n\r\n### No Soldier Left Behind\r\n_**Fireteam Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nWhile under the effects of On Your Six, if either you or your companion are reduced to 0 hit points, you can end On Your Six to have them drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do so, the effects of On Your Six persist until the start of your next turn.",

As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\r\n\r\n### Frenzy\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can go into a frenzy when you enter your rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.\r\n\r\nThe first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion when your rage ends each time you use it.\r\n\r\nWhen you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2, instead of 1. Additionally, any effect that removes exhaustion reduces your exhaustion by 1 additional level.\r\n\r\n### Maniacal Rage\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile raging, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.\r\n\r\n### Mindless Rage\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 6th level_\r\nYou can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\r\n\r\n### Intimidating Presence\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 10th level_\r\nYou can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. While raging, you add double your proficiency bonus to the save DC, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n### Retaliation\r\n_**Frenzied Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.",

        "text": "Throughout the galaxy there exists scientists who focus on unraveling the mysteries contained within the bodies of the divese sentients of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Geneticist Pursuit put their knowledge into practice, splicing their own genetic material to become superior beings... or monsters.\r\n\r\n### Genesplicer's Methods\r\n_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with geneticist's implements and your choice of Medicine or Survival skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Mutagenic Analysis\r\n_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can add half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of one) to any saving throw you make that doesn't already include that modifier. \r\n\r\n### Mutagenic Transformation\r\n_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you target yourself with your Critical Analysis feature, you can choose to undergo a mutagenic transformation. Your form shifts, exaggerating and strengthening your geneticist discoveries for 1 hour. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n- Your Strength score becomes equal to your Critical Analysis score.\r\n- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\nYou can end this effect early on your turn as a bonus action. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Geneticist's Resilience\r\n_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYour genetic alterations make you immune to poison and disease. Additionally, you have resistance to poison damage.\r\n\r\n### Chimeric Adaptation\r\n_**Geneticist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYour genetic modifications have reached new heights. When you complete a short or long rest, you can choose one of the following features. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you also gain the benefits of the chosen feature for the duration. You can only have one of these features at a time.\r\n\r\n#### Aspect of the Terentatek\r\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against force powers, and when a creature within 30 feet of you casts a force power, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the creature. You must end this movement closer to the creature than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the creature, you can make one melee attack against the creature (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Aspect of the Rancor\r\nYou gain proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws. Additionally, you gain immunity to the frightened condition, \r\nand when you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed strike, you can deal an additional 1d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage.\r\n\r\n#### Aspect of the Varactyl\r\nYou gain proficiency in Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws. Additionally, your speed increases by 10 feet, your attack rolls can't suffer from disadvantage, creatures can't have advantage on attack rolls against you, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.\r\n\r\n### Geneticist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the changes you have caused your own body to undergo. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Adapted Hide\r\nWhen you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you are adapted to hot or cold climates (your choice), as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you add your full Critical Analysis ability modifer, instead of half, to your AC for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Atmospheric Adaptation\r\nYou can breathe air and water. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you no longer need to breathe, and you can survive up to one hour within the vacuum of space for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Musculature\r\nYour carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, when you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Icarian Mutation\r\nYou sprout a pair of winged arms. You gain a flying speed equal to half your walking speed. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required). When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your flying speed increases to your full walking speed, and you can use your bonus action to take the Dash action for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Mutagenic Hardiness\r\nYour hit point maximum increases by a number equal to your level, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, and at the beginning of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your half your scholar level + your Critical Analysis ability modifer for the duration.\r\n\r\n#### Predatory Senses\r\nYou have darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range instead increases by 30 feet. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for the duration. Additionally, you can track creatures that have left a scent in the last 24 hours.\r\n\r\n#### Underground Adaptation\r\nYou gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. In order to use this speed, you must have two free hands. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet for the duration. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.\r\n\r\n#### Unnatural Weaponry\r\nYou sprout claws or some other natural weapon. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage, and you can use your choice of your Strength, Dexterity, or Critical Analysis ability modifer for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your unarmed strikes increase to a d6 and are considered enhanced for the duration. Additionally, you deal an additional 1d4 acid, lightning, or poison damage when you hit with them.",

        "text": "Among the galaxy you may find the various infiltrators and agents who make ample use of holographic technology to get themselves in and out of danger. Followers of the Illusionist Technique make use of this holographic technology to give themselves an illusory edge in combat.\r\n\r\n### Holographic Decoy\r\n_**Illusionist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nAs an action, you can create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 10 minutes, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.\r\n\r\nYou can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.\r\n\r\nA creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \r\n\r\n### Mark of the Illusionist\r\n_**Illusionist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nThe target of your Ranger's Quarry feature has disadvantage on all checks made to discern the nature of your illusions. Additionally, when the target of your Ranger's Quarry is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to immediately cause an active illusion, or your Holographic Decoy, to take the form of the creature as long as the creature's dimensions fall within the power's capacity restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Charged Illusions\r\n_**Illusionist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhen a creature discerns the nature of an illusion you have created using a tech power or class feature while within 5 feet of it, you can dispel the illusion (no action required) to have the creature take energy damage equal to 1d10 + half your scout level. \r\n\r\n### Quick Escape\r\n_**Illusionist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhenever you take damage, you can use your reaction to swap places with an illusion of yourself that you have created using a tech power or class feature. The illusion must be within 60 feet of you, and you must be able to see it.\r\n\r\n### Improved Decoys\r\n_**Illusionist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use your Holographic Decoy feature. When you use your bonus action to move a decoy, you can move any number of them with the same bonus action.",

        "text": "While some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Industrious Tech\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action and the power does not require concentration. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast that require a tech attack or saving throw. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. \r\n\r\nCasting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.\r\n\r\n### Explosive Resilience\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 6th level_\r\nOnce per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Painkiller\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 10th level_\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.\r\n\r\n### Final Countdown\r\n_**Industrial Approach:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point (no action required). If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they take 1d12 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\n##### Industrial Approach Techcasting",

On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the force power fails, and the force points are wasted.\r\n- Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a force power, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the power.\r\n\r\nThe radius of this feature increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Sense Force\r\n_**Inquisitor Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYou can use your action to gain the benefits of the *force sight* force power until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table.

As an action, you can charge up to twice your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, the target chooses the ability they use use).

Kage warriors learn tricks to create darkness where none exists, fighting using their intuition rather than relying on sight.\r\n\r\n### Darkness Charges\r\n_**Kage Order:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to create a number of small charges that create enhanced darkness. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two charges. You can create an additional charge at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nOnce per turn, when you would make a weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a device at a point you can see within range. The charges create a pocket of darkness in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The darkness spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until an enhanced source of bright light dispells it.\r\n\r\n### Disruptive Shock\r\n_**Kage Order:** 6th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack when you have advantage, or it fails a saving throw against an effect that you control, you can choose to roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### One With Darkness\r\n_**Kage Order:** 11th level_\r\nYou have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a power, otherwise take a hostile action, or are in an area of bright light.\r\n\r\n### Opportunist\r\n_**Kage Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.",

        "text": "Monks of the Kro Var Order�known as shapers�utilize a unique power to bend the four elements to their will, creating effects as small as a floating flame to quakes that sunder the earth.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Attunement\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to bend the elements to your will. As an action, you can manipulate these forces to create one of the following effects of your choice at a space within 10 feet of you:\r\n- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.\r\n- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\r\n- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.\r\n- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThis range increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to conjure a weapon made of one of the four elements�air, earth, fire, or water�which lasts for 1 minute. Your weapon takes an appearance of your choice, it can only be used by you, and you can't be disarmed of it while you are conscious. You are proficient in this weapon, which counts as a monk weapon for you and uses your Martial Arts die for its damage rolls. You can only have one of these weapons at a time, and if you summon a new one the old one immediately disappears.\r\n\r\n#### Air\r\nYour whistling weapon has the returning property, the thrown property with a range of 20/60, and deals sonic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with the weapon, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Earth\r\nYour earthen weapon takes the form of stone, and deals kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Fire\r\nYour flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your focus ability modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\n#### Water\r\nYour watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your focus ability modifier instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Adept\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou gain two of the following features. You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level. \r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Burning Ember Flourish\r\nYou can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.\r\n\r\n***Fireworks.*** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.\r\n\r\n#### Curtain of Unyielding Wind\r\nAs an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.\r\n\r\n#### Crushing Hand of the Mountain\r\nAs an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\r\n\r\n#### Hatchling's Flame\r\nAs an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame \r\n\r\n30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n#### Patient Bantha Listens\r\nYou reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.\r\n\r\n#### Rush of the Shyrack\r\nAs an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\r\n\r\n#### Shape the Raincloud\r\nYou can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.\r\n\r\n#### Swarming Ice Rabbit\r\nAs an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Master\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 11th and 17th level_\r\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.\r\n\r\nYou can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Earth Reaches for Sky\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Crushing Hand of the Mountain_ or _Patient Bantha Listens_\r\nAs an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\r\n\r\n#### Ride the Wind\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Curtain of Unyielding Wind_ or _Rush of the Shyrack_\r\nAs an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.\r\n\r\n#### River of Hungry Flame\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Burning Ember Flourish_ or _Hatchling's Flame_\r\nAs an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\r\n\r\nOne side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\r\n\r\n#### Shape the Flowing River\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Rainclud_ or _Swarming Ice Rabbit_\r\nAs an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. \r\n\r\n***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\r\n\r\n***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.\r\n\r\n***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\r\n\r\n### Elemental Paragon\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou gain one of the following features. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 4 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 4 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Archetype of Air\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Ride the Wind_\r\nAs an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.\r\n- You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the technique ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.\r\n\r\n- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n#### Figure of Flame\r\n_**Prerequisite:** River of Hungry Flame_\r\nAs an action, you cause flames to race across your body, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- You have resistance to fire damage.\r\n- The flames shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.\r\n- Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.\r\n- You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n#### Icon of Ice\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Flowing River_\r\nAs an action, you cause frost to chill the area around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- You have resistance to cold damage.\r\n- You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.\r\n- The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.\r\n- You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing ice extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n#### Embodiment of Earth\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Earth Reaches for Sky_\r\nAs an action, you cause rock to envelop you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n- You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.\r\n- You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\n### Avatar\r\n_**Kro Var Order:** 17th level_\r\nAs an ultimate display of your mastery of the elements, you can spend 5 focus points as an action to have the elements of water, earth, fire, and air form a protective sphere around your body, gaining multiple benefits for 1 minute. While this ability is active, you have resistance to cold, energy, fire, kinetic, lightning, and sonic damage. You also gain a burrow, fly, and swim speed equal to your movement speed. Lastly, you can use any of the following abilities as a bonus action:\r\n- You create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius around you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage and is knocked prone.\r\n- You create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n- You create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.\r\n- You create a 15-foot cone of ice shards extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution save throw. A creature takes 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.",

Inspired by the skill of native kyuzo wielding their war helmets as both shield and weapon, these monks utilize any thrown object they can find to defend themselves and others while they attack enemies from angles both surprising and devastating.\r\n\r\n### Intercept\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in vibroweapons with the thrown property and they become monk weapons for you. Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it uses your Martial Arts die instead of its 1d4. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, and a creature within your weapon's normal thrown range is hit by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to throw your weapon to intercept the projectile. When you do so, the damage the creature takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If the weapon has the returning property, it then returns to your hand.\r\n\r\n### Scattering Stance\r\n_**Kyuzo Order:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you take the Dodge action, until the start of your next turn you gain a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use for your Intercept feature.

        "text": "Those operatives who choose the Lethality Practice use disguises to get close to their enemies, then leverage the toxic power of poisons to debilitate them and capitalize on their weaknesses. \r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.\r\n\r\n### Assassinate\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.\r\n\r\n### Lethal Strikes\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. \r\n\r\nSome of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Priming Attack\r\nYou attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.\r\n\r\n#### Target Assessment\r\nYou attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:\r\n- Highest ability score\r\n- Lowest ability score\r\n- Strongest saving throw\r\n- Weakest saving throw\r\n\r\n#### Vulnerable Strike\r\nYou attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.\r\n\r\n### Poisoner\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou are a master of poisons. You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach. If the poison is applied before the end of your next short or long rest, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist your poison. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Impostor\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person's behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.\r\n\r\nYour ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.\r\n\r\n### Death Strike\r\n_**Lethality Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou've become a master of instant death. When you deal weapon damage to a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your lethal strike save DC. On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.",

Followers of the Mastermind Technique focus on being prepared for any eventuality, and using their breadth of knowledge to gain insights into their enemies.\r\n\r\n### Instinctive Combatant\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned to use your wits to help you survive. While you are wearing light or medium armor, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC. \r\n\r\n### Mark of the Meticulous\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use Intelligence instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against the target of your Ranger's Quarry.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once per round, when you hit the target of your Ranger's Quarry with a tech attack, or it fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can deal additional damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry damage die of the same type as the tech power's damage.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Techie\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you complete a long rest, you can choose up to a number of tech powers you know equal to half your Intelligence modifier and replace them with another tech power, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n### Emergency Planning\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou've learned to formulate and execute a plan. As an action, you can choose up to six creatures (including yourself) that you can see within 60 feet of you. For each creature, choose one of the following: ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Each creature gains an Emergency Planning die, which is a d8.\r\n\r\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, each creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, as determined when you use this feature. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Emergency Planning die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Emergency Planning die is rolled, it is lost.\r\n\r\nA creature can have only one Emergency Planning die at a time.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\nYour Emergency Planning die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Exploit Weakness\r\n_**Mastermind Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYour training has taught you to find and exploit weaknesses in your prey. As a bonus action, you can impose disadvantage on the next saving throw the target of your Ranger's Quarry makes against an effect you control before the end of your next turn. Once you've done so, you must complete a short or long rest before you can do so again.",

Followers of the Mechanist Technique make up for the weakness of organics with the strength and purity of their creations.\r\n\r\n### Improved Techcasting\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYour command of techcasting improves.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Tech Powers Known\r\nYou know 7 tech powers of your choice, instead of 5, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to one and a half times your scout level, instead of your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Max Power Level\r\nYour Max Power Level becomes 2nd, instead of 1st, and it increases at higher levels, as shown in the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once, instead of 4th and 5th. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Mechanist\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can cause the target of your Ranger's Quarry to emit an ion pulse, as long as the target is within 60 feet of you. The target, and any creatures within 5 feet of it, must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, roll your Ranger's Quarry die; each creature takes ion damage equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\n### Potent Tech\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nYou can use your ingenuity to bolster yourself or an ally. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:\r\n- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a short or long rest.\r\n- Roll a d4. The creature regains a number of tech points equal to the result. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### High Voltage\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou are used to working with electronics and have learned to increase their potency, while becoming inured to their dangers. You gain resistance to ion and lightning damage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you deal ion damage to a creature, you can spend a tech point to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n##### Mechanist Technique Techcasting\r\n\r\n### Command Droid\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry. That creature must make a Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again for 24 hours. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.\r\n\r\nIntelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.",

        "text": "\r\nSome scouts are peerless inventors, skilled at working with droids and other forms of technology. Followers of the Mechanist Technique utilize the assistance of a tracker droid companion to make up for the weakness of organics with the strength and purity of their creations.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in astrotech�s implements.\r\n\r\n### Improved Techcasting\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYour command of techcasting improves.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Tech Powers Known\r\nYou know 7 tech powers of your choice, instead of 5, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to one and a half times your scout level, instead of your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Max Power Level\r\nYour Max Power Level becomes 2nd, instead of 1st, and it increases at higher levels, as shown in the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once, instead of 4th and 5th. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Tracker Droid Companion\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own tracker droid companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nLastly, while your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to learn the location of any droid or construct, tech focus, tech power or enhanced item within 60 feet of you or your tracker droid that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a tech power in this way, you learn what the power is.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Mechanist\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can cause the target of your Ranger's Quarry to emit an ion pulse, as long as the target is within 60 feet of you. The target, and any creatures within 5 feet of it, must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, roll your Ranger's Quarry die; each creature takes ion damage equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\n##### Mechanist Technique Techcasting\r\n\r\n### High Voltage\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 11th level_\r\nYou are used to working with electronics and have learned to increase their potency, while becoming inured to their dangers. You gain resistance to ion and lightning damage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you deal ion damage to a creature, you can spend a tech point to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Command Droid\r\n_**Mechanist Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYou can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry. That creature must make a Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again for 24 hours. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.\r\n\r\nIntelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.",

        "text": "Those fighters who choose to become Mounted Specialists excel at mounted combat. Mounted Specialists are most dangerous from the seat of a speeder or saddle of a varactyl, though they can hold their own from the ground. Their versatility often has them leading the charge or protecting the team.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Animal Handling or Piloting.\r\n\r\n### Born to the Saddle\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYour mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.\r\n\r\nFinally, mounting or dismounting a creature or vehicle costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.\r\n\r\n### Unwavering Mark\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attacks weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Warding Maneuver\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is dealt damage by an attack, you can roll ld8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the fighter table. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Hold the Line\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nYou become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target gains 4 slowed levels until the end of the current turn.\r\n\r\n### Ferocious Charger\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYou can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.\r\n\r\n### Vigilant Defender\r\n_**Mounted Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.",

Those scholars who choose the Occultist Pursuit learn to harness these magics to bewitch and confound their enemies. \r\n\r\n### Theurgic Research\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in the Lore and Nature skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Curse of Objurgation \r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nWhen you target a creature with your Critical Analysis, you can choose one ability. While it can see you, the target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Heightened Hex\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhen you use your Curse of Objurgation feature, each time the cursed creature deals damage to you or an allied creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of 2).\r\n\r\n### Voodoo Doll\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nOver the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below. \r\n\r\n##### Knowledge Save Modifier\r\n|||\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Secondhand (you have heard of the target) |+5|\r\n|Firsthand (you have met the target) |+0|\r\n|Familiar (you know the target well) |-5|\r\n\r\n##### Connection Save Modifier\r\n|||\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Likeness or picture |-2|\r\n|Curse of Objurgation |-3|\r\n|Possession or garment |-4|\r\n|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |-10|\r\n\r\nOn a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:\r\n- **Burn:** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes it is burning. While burning in this way, the target has has disadvantage on attack rolls made with Strength or Dexterity. This effect lasts for 1 hour.\r\n- **Pain:** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 hour. While in pain in this way, the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage whenever it takes damage.\r\n- **Stab:** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.\r\n\r\nThe target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end. Placing an effect on a target requires maintaining your concentration, as if concentrating on a power.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Toil and Trouble\r\n_**Occultist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou perfect your control of your curses, granting them unmatched potency. When the target of your Curse of \r\n\r\nObjurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when a creature attempts to use a power like *remove curse* or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.\r\n\r\n### Occultist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Arcane Membrane\r\nYou have advantage on Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks.\r\n\r\n#### Evil Eye\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYou can cast the *bestow curse* and *remove curse* force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.\r\n\r\nOnce you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.\r\n\r\n#### Exsanguination\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nWhen a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.\r\n\r\n#### Hexes and Superstitions \r\nWhen you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.\r\n\r\n#### Natural Karma\r\nBefore you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.\r\n\r\n#### Savage Sortilege\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nYou ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.\r\n\r\n#### Supernatural Vigor\r\nAt the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power. The creature's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to your scholar level, and it has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion. Both effects end after 8 hours.",

        "text": "Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.\r\n\r\n### Mystical Connection\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the *feedback* force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Symbiot Spirit\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_\r\nYou attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.\r\n- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.\r\n- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\r\n- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\r\n- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.\r\n\r\nYou can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.\r\n\r\n> #### Generating Your Spirit\r\n> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Invasive Presence\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 7th level_\r\nYour spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. \r\n\r\nOn a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Ethereal Vision\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 13th level_\r\nYou and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Assuming Direct Control\r\n_**Path of Communion:** 18th level_\r\nWhen a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.\r\n\r\nWhile the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.\r\n\r\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.",

While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Ethereality instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.\r\n\r\n### Aberrant Resilience\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Kinesis\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_\r\nYour connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self option, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take true damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. \r\n\r\n### Out of Touch\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 7th level_\r\nAs an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. \r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Event Cascade\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 13th level_\r\nYou have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures if you haven't dealt damage to them or affected them with a force power since the start of your previous turn.\r\n\r\n### Aberrant Self\r\n_**Path of Ethereality:** 18th level_\r\nYou no longer suffer the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep. Lastly, the first time you take damage on each of your turns, you can roll your Kinetic Combat die and reduce the damage by that amount.",

Those sentinels who follow the Path of Meditation embody these concepts, empowering their allies and hindering their enemies through the use of the ancient Force technique of battle meditation.\r\n\r\n### Sage Counsel\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *guidance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Allies\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_\r\nWhile you are concentrating on a power that benefits a friendly creature other than you, you gain new ways to utilize your Force-Empowered Self features. Each option costs 1 force point, and you can only target a creature that is benefiting from a power you cast.\r\n\r\n#### Deflection\r\nWhen an ally is hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to add it to your ally's AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.\r\n\r\n#### Double Strike\r\nWhen an ally hits with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to deal additional damage of the same type as the attack.\r\n\r\n#### Slow Time\r\nWhen an ally moves on their turn, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of the turn.\r\n\r\n### Unbreakable Focus\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 7th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\r\n\r\n### Turbulent Presence\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 13th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *improved battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *improved battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once per round, when a creature rolls a bonus or penalty die from an effect you control, you can have them roll the die with advantage or disadvantage (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Legendary Battle Meditation\r\n_**Path of Meditation:** 18th level_\r\nOnce per long rest, you can cast the *master battle meditation* force power without expending force points.

Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting Secrets\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. \r\n\r\nAt 7th level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.\r\n\r\n### Synthetic Understanding\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\nFinally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Tech\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Disruption Pulse\r\nAs an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Forced Override\r\nWhen you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Insight\r\nAs an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.\r\n\r\n### Improved Force-Empowered Tech\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 13th level_\r\nYou've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.\r\n\r\n#### Harmonic Synthesis\r\nWhen you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.\r\n\r\n#### Conservation of Energy\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Reflective Shield\r\n_**Path of Synthesis:** 18th level_\r\nWhen you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the incoming energy and potentially reflect it back at your attacker. You use your reaction to have resistance against the triggering damage, and if the source of the damage is within 5 feet of you, they take half of the total damage dealt as ion.",

The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Ward\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your sentinel level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so.

You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Bulwark\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 7th level_\r\nYou can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. \r\n\r\n### Indomitable\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 13th level_\r\nThe Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.\r\n\r\n### Kinetic Bastion\r\n_**Path of Tenacity:** 18th level_\r\nYou can protect allies even further from you.

Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save.

Once on each of your turns, when you cast a force power and deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can conjure a familiar within 5 feet of it (no action required). The familiar takes the form of a humanoid or beast made of green, glowing smoke, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another spirit, or until you're incapacitated or die.\r\n\r\nYour familiar has an AC equal to your universal force save DC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.\r\n- When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.\r\n- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.\r\n\r\nStarting at 11th level, you can summon your familiar when you deal damage with any force power, instead of just necrotic. Additionally, you can summon your familiar when you use a Force-Empowered Self option on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Nature's Vigor\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_\r\nYou've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:\r\n- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.\r\n- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.\r\n- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Waters of Life\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th level_\r\nYou've learned to absorb the fleeting magicks of your familiar. When your familiar is destroyed by taking damage, you can choose to grant temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to one friendly creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Stormcaller\r\n_**Path of Witchcraft:** 18th level_\r\nYou've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\r\n- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.\r\n- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Corsair make use of alternative weaponry not commonly associated with force-wielders to great effect.\r\n\r\n### Scavenger's Reach\r\n_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn the *force disarm* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option to deal kinetic damage when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, when you cast the *force disarm* force power, disarm a blaster weapon, and catch it, you can reload the weapon as a part of the same action.\r\n\r\n### Corsair Weapons\r\n_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use the force to quickly learn the use of unfamiliar weapons. When you hold a weapon that you are not proficient in, you can spend 1 force point (no action required) to gain proficiency with that weapon until the end of your next long rest. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Detonators\r\n_**Path of the Corsair:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to infuse a number of small detonators with the Force. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of detonators equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Your detonators can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can throw one of your detonators at a point within range. Your detonators have a range equal to 30 feet + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier x 5. Make a universal ranged force attack. On a hit, the detonator adheres to the target, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is pushed back 5 feet. On a miss, it falls to the ground. Hit or miss, the detonator then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the detonator adhered to a target, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes force damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\n### Energized Kinetics\r\n_**Path of the Corsair:** 13th level_\r\nOnce per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die. The damage type is force, lightning, necrotic, or psychic (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Disorienting Detonations\r\n_**Path of the Corsair:** 18th level_\r\nWhen a creature fails the saving throw against your Force-Empowered Detonators feature, you can spend 2 force points to subject it to the effects of one of the following force powers: *affliction, force blind/deafen, stun,* or *stun droid*. They automatically fail the saving throw for the selected power, but the effects only last until the end of your next turn.",

You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and one musical instrument of your choice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while you are not wearing armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, you can add half your Charisma modifier to your AC as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Dazzling Steps\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to conduct impressive displays of grace and speed in combat. While you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield, and you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon with either the light or finesse properties, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a dazzling step.\r\n\r\nSome of your dazzling steps require your target to make a saving throw to resist the dazzling step's effects.

Roll two Sneak Attack dice. You gain temporary hit points that last until the start of your next turn equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile Step\r\nYou twist and twirl around the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds. On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Offensive Step\r\nChoose another creature that you can see within your reach. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, roll two Sneak Attack dice. The creature takes damage equal to the amount rolled. This damage is of the same as your weapon's damage.\r\n\r\n### Flexible Body\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou are able to use your acrobatic talent to gain the upper hand in combat. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to shove or trip a creature. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you now ignore difficult terrain, you can move through space occupied by hostile creatures, and you can squeeze through smaller spaces without expending extra movement.\r\n\r\n### Dance of Death\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use your action to make a weapon attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. You can choose to deal Sneak Attack damage to each creature you hit, but you can only roll half your number of Sneak Attack dice per creature.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Master of Dance\r\n_**Performance Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYour confidence when putting on a show has extended into combat. You add your Charisma modifier to initiative checks. Additionally, any creature who fails a saving throw against your Dazzling Step save DC has disadvantage on the first attack roll they make against you each turn until the end of your next turn.",

If you take the Attack action on your turn and have advantage on an attack roll against one of the targets, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional weapon attack against that target, as part of the same action. You can do so no more than once per turn.\r\n\r\n### Strength Before Weakness\r\n_**Praetorian Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYour fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn.

        "text": "Those operatives who choose the Ruffian Practice use rough-and-tumble tactics to handle any fight, big or small. They incite chaos and make devious moves that keep their enemies reeling.\r\n\r\n### Rakish Audacity\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYour unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.\r\n\r\nFinally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.\r\n\r\n### Nimble Step\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.\r\n\r\nSome of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Nimble Step save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Blade Defense\r\nYou attempt to determine your target's next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.\r\n\r\n#### Disarming Strike\r\nYou attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.\r\n\r\n#### Fancy Footwork\r\nRoll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.\r\n\r\n### Panache\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYour charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.\r\n\r\nIf you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.\r\n\r\nIf you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.\r\n\r\n### Elegant Maneuver\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.\r\n\r\n### Master Duelist\r\n_**Ruffian Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYour mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.",

See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your operative level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Saboteur Practice Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Tracker Droid Companion\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own tracker droid companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of tracker droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).\r\n\r\nLastly, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that would affect only one target, and your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you or your target, your tracker droid companion can use its reaction to increase the level at which you are casting your power by 1. This feature can increase a power's level above your Max Power Level, and using this feature does not cost additional tech points.\r\n\r\nAt 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the operative table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Powered Ambush\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 9th level_\r\nIf you are hidden from a creature when you cast a power on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the power this turn.\r\n\r\n### Ion Pulse\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 13th level_\r\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more of your tracker droid's Hit Dice to have it emit an pulse of ion energy. Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. The size of the damage die equals the size of your tracker droid's Hit Die. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.\r\n\r\n##### Saboteur Practice Techcasting\r\n\r\n### Sabotage\r\n_**Saboteur Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.\r\n\r\nOn a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. \r\n\r\nAt the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

        "text": "Those operatives who choose the Sawbones Practice have studied the humanoid body on a more intimate level than other operatives. While others may know where best to stab in order to kill, you also know how to repair the wounds you inflict, as well as how to make them even deeper. You delve into the secrets of the body, learning as much medical knowledge as you can get your hands on, regardless of how dirty the work becomes.\r\n\r\n### General Practice\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Medicine, and you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier for checks made with it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can expend one use of a traumakit to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\r\n\r\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Debilitating Strike\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to apply your anatomical knowledge in direct combat, in order to hinder your targets. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.\r\n\r\nSome of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Debilitating Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Bleeding Wound\r\nYou attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target's turns, it takes true damage equal to one Sneak Attack die and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. \r\n\r\n#### Crippling Pain\r\nYou attempt to cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n#### Hampering Shot\r\nYou attempt to hamper the target's movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n### Swift Surgery\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 9th level_\r\nYou know how to quickly patch up wounds, given the right tools. You are able to use a traumakit or administer a medpac as a bonus action, and when you use a traumakit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n### Dosage Control\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYour knowledge of medicine allows you to partition and ration healing supplies very effectively, without impacting its potency. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a rest, you can carefully measure and mark out dosages of a medpac within reach. The medpac can now be used twice before it is consumed.\r\n\r\nAt your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.\r\n\r\n### Self-Sustain\r\n_**Sawbones Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou have advantage on death saving throws.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you are stabilized, you regain 1 hit point. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

They utilize close-quarters blaster combat blended with underhanded tactics to surprise and disable their foes.\r\n\r\n### Back Blast\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in all blasters with the burst or rapid property that lack the two-handed property. Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn't have advantage on the save.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach 9th level in this class, when multiple creatures fail a saving throw against the burst property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can divide your Sneak Attack dice amongst the targets as you see fit.\r\n\r\n### Upper Hand\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 3rd level_\r\nYou learn to use underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.\r\n\r\nSome of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Upper Hand save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Brutal Hit\r\nYou attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\r\n\r\n#### Low Blow\r\nYou attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Shank Shot\r\nYou attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is to 0 and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n### Sleight of Foot\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 9th level_\r\nWhen a creature moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed away from the creature without provoking opportunity attacks. You must end this movement further from the creature than you started.\r\n\r\n### Hostile Negotiations\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 13th level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Intimidation or Persuasion. Additionally, while you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, you can't have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and if the target would make a contested check, they can't have advantage on it.\r\n\r\n### Double Tap\r\n_**Scrapper Practice:** 17th level_\r\nYou can deal Sneak Attack damage twice per turn, but you can't deal more than your total Sneak Attack dice to a single target per turn.",

Those guardians who focus on Shii-Cho Form make seemingly random, yet deliberate, attacks to knock their opponents off-balance.\r\n\r\n### Form Basics\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the Shii-Cho lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.\r\n\r\n### The Way of the Sarlaac\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can enter a frenetic stance for one minute. While in this stance, the first time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, it has disadvantage on the next melee attack roll it makes against you before the start of your next turn. Additionally, if that creature is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the following Channel the Force option.\r\n\r\n#### Disarming Slash\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required)  to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.\r\n\r\n### Unpredictable Motion\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 7th level_\r\nWhile you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon, opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage.\r\n\r\n### Sarlaac Sweep\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 15th level_\r\nWhen a creature moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature. If the attack hits, you can attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.\r\n\r\n### Master of Determination\r\n_**Shii-Cho Form:** 20th level_\r\nThe erratic fluidity of your movement confounds even the most determined of foes. Your Strength or Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.\r\n- Attack rolls made against you can't have advantage.\r\n- When more than one creature is within 5 feet of you, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of creatures within 5 feet of you, up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).\r\n- When you use your Sarlaac Sweep feature, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can apply the bonus damage to every creature within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

Those scholars who choose the Slicer Pursuit put their impressive intellectual prowess to work in the field of technology, to ends both benevolent and malicious.\r\n\r\n### Hacker's Disposition\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with slicer's kits and in the Technology skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to half of your scholar level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Systems Hijack\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nAlso at 3rd level, when the target of your Critical Analysis is a droid or construct, or wearing or holding a techcasting focus, that creature is a viable target for any tech powers with you cast with a range of touch.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when the target of your Critical Analysis casts a tech power, you can use your reaction to identify the tech power being cast, and at what level.\r\n\r\n### Potent Programming\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nWhen a creature succeeds on a saving throw against an at-will tech power you cast that deals damage, the creature takes half the power's damage, but suffers no additional effects of the power.\r\n\r\n### Redirect Error\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nWhen the target of your Critical Analysis feature casts a tech power that affects an area, you can use your reaction to cause that power to instead affect an area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the caster. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### System Override\r\n_**Slicer Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou know how to quickly activate anti-tech subroutines you have encoded into your wristpad. You can cast the *diminish tech* and *tech override* powers at 3rd level without expending tech points. If the target is the target of your Critical Analysis, you have advantage on the techcasting ability check for these powers.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Slicer Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Administrator's Log\r\nIf you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.\r\n\r\n#### Backdoor Egress\r\nWhen you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. \r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Core Override\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou can cast the *override interface* tech power at 5th level without spending tech points. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Resource Appropriation\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_\r\nIf you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Skillful Casting\r\nWhen you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.\r\n\r\n#### Sleeper Program\r\nWhenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table. You regain all expended uses  when you finish a long rest.",

Those guardians who focus on Persistence Form make use of the terrain, trying to maneuver their opponents into vulnerable areas before dispatching them.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in heavy armor.\r\n\r\n### Form Basics\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the Sokan lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.\r\n\r\n### The Way of the Varactyl\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can enter an unyielding stance for one minute. While in this stance, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to shove, trip, and avoid being moved, and you ignore difficult terrain. Additionally, once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to shove the target up to 10 feet away from you (no action required).\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain the following Channel the Force option.\r\n\r\n#### High Ground Defense\r\nWhen an opponent within 5 feet of you makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Channel the Force to move to another space within 5 feet of that creature without provoking opportunity attacks, imposing disadvantage on the roll. If the attack misses, you can attempt to shove the creature up to 10 feet away from you as a part of that same reaction.\r\n\r\n### Unwavering Self\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 7th and 15th level_\r\nIf you fail a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new roll.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again. At 15th level you can use this feature twice between long rests.\r\n\r\n### Unhindered Charge\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 15th level_\r\nWen you move at least 10 feet before making a melee weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n### Master of Persistence\r\n_**Sokan Form:** 20th level_\r\nYou are an unrelenting force on the field of battle. Your Strength and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.\r\n- You ignore effects that would reduce your speed.\r\n- Once per turn, when you push a creature, you can move up to 10 feet as a part of this push without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement within 5 feet of that creature, you can make one melee weapon attack (no action required).\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

        "text": "Whether through experimentation or discovery of an ancient technology, followers of the Teleportation Technique have learned to create brief teleportation portals, allowing them to maneuver and attack both quickly and unpredictably throughout the battlefield.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in tinker's implements.\r\n\r\n### Personal Teleporter\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).\r\n\r\nThe distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.\r\n\r\n### Mark of the Teleporter\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_\r\nOn your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) in this way.\r\n\r\n### Residual Warp\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.\r\n\r\n### Quantum Entanglement\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.\r\n\r\n### Reprisal\r\n_**Teleportation Technique:** 15th level_\r\nWhen you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.",

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.\r\n\r\nThese effects end early if you are incapacitated or die.

While you are in this stance, you gain the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- **Charging Wampa.** Once per round, when you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, your movement speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.\r\n- **Nexu Grin.** When a creature you can see within 10 feet of you casts a force power that requires a force attack roll against you or an an allied creature, you can use your reaction and expend 1 focus point to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, and the higher of the two d20 rolls would also miss, the creature cannot cast that force power again until it completes a short or long rest.\r\n- **Screaming Squill.** Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is concentrating on a force power and it makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, the DC for the check equals your focus save DC, unless the DC for the Constitution saving throw would be higher.\r\n\r\nThese effects end early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 focus point to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Matter Over Mind\r\n_**Teras Kasi Order:** 11th level_\r\nYou tap into the greater power of your focus. While both your Forredari Stance and your Steel Hands Form are active, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- **Dancing Dragonsnake.** When you take force, lightning, or necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your focus ability modifier + your monk level.\r\n- **Aryx Slash.** Once on each of your turns, when you hit a target with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.\r\n- **Piercing Gaze.** When you would make an Insight check against a creature you know to wield the Force, you can use your focus ability modifier for the roll, and you are considered to have expertise in the Insight skill. If you would already have expertise in the check, you instead have advantage on the roll. \r\n\r\n### Spitting Rawl\r\n_**Teras Kasi Order:** 17th level_\r\nYou have learned to harness your strikes in a blistering fury. On your turn, when a creature takes damage from you three times, you can make up to three additional unarmed strikes against the creature (no action required). The first additional unarmed strike costs 1 focus point and deals 1d12 additional psychic damage on a hit, and each unarmed strike after the first costs 1 additional focus point and deals 1d12 additional psychic damage on a hit, cumulatively.",

        "text": "Those fighters who become Totem Specialists tap into a primal attunement to the Force, applying tribal ceremony to create powerful talismans that enhance their abilities.\r\n\r\n### Bonus Proficiencies\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency with your choice of artist's implements or jeweler's implements.\r\n\r\n### Totem Creation\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've learned to create powerful talismans infused with the Force. Your totems can take the form of sigils painted directly onto your equipment, or adornments attached to it, as you see fit. Regardless of the form they take, only you can benefit from them. You learn two totems of your choice, which are detailed under \"Totems\" below. When you complete a long rest, you can replace one totem you know with a different one.\r\n\r\nWhen you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of weapons, armor, or shields equal to the number of totems you know, affixing a different totem to each object. Your totem remains affixed until you finish a long rest, and an object can only bear one totem at a time. You must be wielding or wearing the object to benefit from a totem affixed to it.\r\n\r\nEach totem can be invoked to grant an effect. Once you've invoked a totem in this way, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Totem Options\r\nThe totems are listed in alphabetical order. If a totem requires a saving throw, the DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). \r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Acklay\r\nThis totem evokes the ferocity of an acklay, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action. For 10 minutes, your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles, and your Strength score increases by 2. This increase can cause your score to exceed 20. \r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Hawk\r\nThis totem is inspired by the visage of a hawk, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw by emitting a powerful sound. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is dazed, suffering from the charmed condition, for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the totem, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. A deaf creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Loth-wolf\r\nThis totem emulates the near etherealness of a loth-wolf, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker) that you can see, using the same roll. This ability can transfer the attack regardless of the attack's range. \r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Rancor\r\nThis totem bestows a resilience reminiscent of a mighty rancor, granting you advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance to poison damage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action, gaining resistance to energy and kinetic damage for 1 minute. \r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Sarlacc\r\nThis totem channels the experience of an ancient sarlacc, granting you expertise in any one tool in which you are proficient.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can invoke the totem to summon the tentacles of the creature: The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the tentacles, the target takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, tearing free on a success.\r\n\r\n#### Totem of the Vornskr\r\nWith this totem you are able to access the Force-enhanced senses of the vornskr, granting you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you are not incapacitated.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action to enter a state of hyper awareness for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. \r\n\r\n### Totemic Might \r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can channel the power of your Force awareness temporarily. As a bonus action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute. You can invoke a totem as a part of this same bonus action.\r\n- Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\r\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\r\n- Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Guardian Spirit\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 7th level_\r\nYou learn to invoke your totems to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the creature's AC against that attack. The bonus equals 1 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +2).\r\n\r\n### Primal Avatar\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 10th level_\r\nYou learn a third totem. Additionally, the bonus damage of your Totemic Might feature increases to 1d8. Lastly, you have advantage on Lore checks you make about tribal cultures.\r\n\r\n### Spirit Guide\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 15th level_\r\nYou can invoke each of your totems twice, instead of once. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Blessing of the Tree of Light\r\n_**Totem Specialist:** 18th level_\r\nYou learn how to share your totem's power with your allies. When you use your Totemic Might feature, you can choose one willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The chosen creature also gains the benefits of your Totemic Might feature. If you are incapacitated or killed, this effect immediately ends for both of you.",

If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.\r\n\r\n### The Way of the Monkey-Lizard\r\n_**Trakata Form:** 3rd level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can enter a confusing stance for one minute. As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, when you take the Dodge action, you can make one melee weapon attack against a creature within range. Additionally, when you make this melee weapon attack, you can flourish your weapon to attempt to distract your target. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by a Wisdom (Perception) check of the target of your attack.

Additionally, if the target is within 60 feet of you, when it is forced to make a Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to force it to make the roll with disadvantage. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n- While a friendly creature is the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to stabilize it.

When you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to another creature with a tech power or class feature, you recover the same amount of hit points or gain the same number of temporary hit points. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Experimental Infusion\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 11th level_\r\nWhen you target a creature with your Ranger's Quarry, you can grant one of the following additional effects of your choice:\r\n- ***Adrenaline/Tranquilizer.*** The creature's movement speed is doubled until the end of its next turn.

Alternatively, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to your scout level and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nYou can use each feature once. You regain any expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Cure-All\r\n_**Triage Technique:** 15th level_\r\nYour healing becomes even more potent.

The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nThis feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level, and four weapons at 17th level. When you use your action to attack with your weapons, you can direct them at the same target or at different ones.

When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend a number of force points up to your proficiency bonus to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the number of points spent.\r\n\r\n### Isolate\r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Sapping Storm \r\n_**Way of Manipulation:** 18th level_\r\nWhen you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

Those consulars who follow the Way of Technology pair their mastery of the Force with the versatility of technology, applying the knowledge in tandem to perform unseen feats.\r\n \r\n### Fundamentals of Mechu-deru\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting Secrets\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou've learned to mimic technological effects. Choose two tech powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the consular table.\r\n\r\nAt 7th level, you learn two additional tech powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of the same level.\r\n\r\n### Ionized Weave\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 10th level_\r\nWhen you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can spend force points to cause that power to instead deal ion damage. The number of force points equals half the power's level (round down, minimum of one). If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. \r\n\r\n### Force Circuitry\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you use your action to cast a force power, and you use your Fundamentals of Mechu-deru feature as a part of that casting, you can use your bonus action to cast one of the tech powers you know, as long as that power has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Mechu-deru Mastery\r\n_**Way of Technology:** 18th level_\r\nYou can cast one 5th-level tech power of your choice at its base level. The power counts as a universal force power for you, and you do not require force points to cast this power. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.",

When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.\r\n\r\n### Powerful Mind\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 6th level_\r\nYou can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.\r\n\r\nAs an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you.

The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. \r\n\r\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Visions of the Past\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 10th level_\r\nYou can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events.

If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.\r\n\r\n***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.\r\n\r\n### Shielded Thoughts\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 14th level_\r\nYour thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. \r\n\r\n### Clarity of Vision\r\n_**Way of the Seer:** 18th level_\r\nThe visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come.

        "text": "\r\nMany academics develop an affinity for nature, studying the vast fauna that inhabit the different planets throughout the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Zoologist Pursuit capitalize on their knowledge of animals, developing a strong bond with a companion with whom they gain an advantage on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n### Wilderness Expert\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain proficiency in Animal Handling, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks.\r\n\r\n### Beast Companion\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to forge a powerful bond with your own beast companion.\r\n\r\nCreate your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:\r\n- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your number of available Hit Dice that can be spend to restore hit points is reduced by 1.\r\n\r\nLastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains a bonus to ability checks, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\nThis radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Vicious Hunting\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 6th level_\r\nYour beast companion's strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. Additionally, when your beast makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may expend a superiority die and apply the benefits of a maneuver you know from this class, as if you had taken the action yourself.\r\n\r\n### Bestial Agility\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 9th level_\r\nYour beast's reflexes and agility allow it to move with a burst of speed. When your beast moves on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once its used this feature, it can't use it again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.\r\n\r\n### Feral Ferocity\r\n_**Zoologist Pursuit:** 17th level_\r\nYou have learned how to push your beast beyond its limits. If your beast is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you, you can command it to enter a furious state. While raging, your beast gains the following benefits:\r\n- Your beast has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws if it is size Medium or larger.\r\n- Your beast has advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws if it is size Small or smaller.\r\n- When your beast hits with an attack, it deals bonus damage equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifer.\r\n- Your beast has resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n\r\nYour beast's furious state lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if your beast is knocked unconscious. You can end your beast's furious state as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Zoologist Discoveries\r\nWhen you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in biology and behaviour of alien lifeforms. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Advantageous Companion\r\nWhen you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check against a creature that can see your beast companion, and your companion is size Medium or larger, you make the check with advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check against a creature that can see your beast companion, and your companion is size Small or Tiny, you make the check with advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Holocam Attachment\r\nYou have learned how to safely attach a holocam on the head of the companion. You learn the *tracker droid interface* tech power, your beast becomes a valid target of this power, and when you cast this power targeting your beast, you do so without spending tech points. You require use of a wristpad for this power.\r\n\r\n#### Neat Tricks\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nYour beast gains proficiency in one Strength or Dexterity skill of your choice. If your beast's size is Medium or larger and the chosen skill uses Strength, it has expertise in the chosen skill. If your beast's size is Small or smaller and the chosen skill uses Dexterity, it has expertise in the chosen skill.\r\n\r\n#### One Big Baddie\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Size Medium or larger beast_\r\nYour beast companion gains the following benefits:\r\n- It deals double damage against structures.\r\n- It can take the Guard action as a bonus action, but it can only guard you in this way.\r\n- It can spend a bonus action to spend one of its Hit Dice to recover hit points.\r\n- When it rolls a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points it can regain from the roll equals twice its Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).\r\n\r\n#### Protective Friend\r\nIf a creature makes a melee attack against you or your companion, and your companion is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\n#### The More the Merrier\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Size Small or smaller beast_\r\nRather than a single beast companion, you instead control multiple beasts that function as a swarm. Your beast companion gains the following benefits:\r\n- Its effective size increases by two categories (from Tiny to Medium or Small to Large).\r\n- Its hit points increase by an amount equal to twice its level + 2.\r\n- It can only be mounted by creatures at least three size categories smaller than it, instead of one.\r\n- It can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and it can move through any opening large enough for a creature two size categories smaller than it.\r\n- While it is above half its hit point maximum, when it takes the Attack action, it can make an additional attack. If the creature has the Extra Attack feature, this attack is in addition to the attack granted by that feature.",
