See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n___\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___",

You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n___\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___",

You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.\r\nWhen you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.\r\nYou use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your focus ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your focus ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a focus feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.\r\n___\r\n**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)\r\n___\r\n**Focus attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)\r\n___\r\n#### Flurry of Blows\r\nWhen you make your Martial Arts bonus action attack, you can spend 1 focus point to make an additional unarmed strike (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to make two additional unarmed strikes.\r\n#### Patient Defense\r\nWhen you use your bonus action to Disengage, you can spend 1 focus point to also Dodge (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to Dodge and gain an additional reaction until the start of your next turn. \r\n#### Step of the Wind\r\nWhen you use your bonus action to Dash, you can spend 1 focus point to double your jump distance for the turn. At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.",

        "text": "_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou have constructed a set of malleable, portable fortifications that can elevate you and your allies. Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. \r\nYour portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:\r\n- Its AC equals your tech save DC.\r\n- It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.\r\n- You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the *mending* tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the *mending* tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.\r\n- Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.\r\nAs an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).\r\nYou can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n#### Bridge\r\nYou deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.\r\n#### Cage\r\nYou create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. \r\n#### Shelter\r\nYou erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.\r\n#### Tower\r\nYou erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n#### Wall\r\nYou deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.",

Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. \r\nYour portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:\r\n- Its AC equals your tech save DC.\r\n- It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.\r\n- You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the *mending* tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the *mending* tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.\r\n- Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.\r\nAs an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).\r\nYou can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n#### Bridge\r\nYou deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.\r\n#### Cage\r\nYou create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. \r\n#### Shelter\r\nYou erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.\r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.\r\n#### Tower\r\nYou erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n#### Wall\r\nYou deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. \r\nWhen you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.",

A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it.

On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\r\n#### Hatchling's Flame\r\nAs an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame \r\n30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n#### Patient Bantha Listens\r\nYou reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.\r\n#### Rush of the Shyrack\r\nAs an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\r\n#### Shape the Raincloud\r\nYou can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.\r\n#### Swarming Ice Rabbit\r\nAs an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.",

You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.\r\n#### Burning Ember Flourish\r\nYou can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.\r\n***Fireworks.*** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.\r\n***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.\r\n#### Curtain of Unyielding Wind\r\nAs an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.\r\n#### Crushing Hand of the Mountain\r\nAs an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\r\n#### Hatchling's Flame\r\nAs an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame \r\n30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n#### Patient Bantha Listens\r\nYou reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.\r\n#### Rush of the Shyrack\r\nAs an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.\r\n#### Shape the Raincloud\r\nYou can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.\r\n#### Swarming Ice Rabbit\r\nAs an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.",

You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\nWhile you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.\r\n#### Earth Reaches for Sky\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Crushing Hand of the Mountain_ or _Patient Bantha Listens_\r\nAs an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\r\n#### Ride the Wind\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Curtain of Unyielding Wind_ or _Rush of the Shyrack_\r\nAs an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.\r\n#### River of Hungry Flame\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Burning Ember Flourish_ or _Hatchling's Flame_\r\nAs an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.\r\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\r\nOne side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\r\n#### Shape the Flowing River\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Rainclud_ or _Swarming Ice Rabbit_\r\nAs an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. \r\n***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\r\n***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.\r\n***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\r\n- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn.

Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it.
