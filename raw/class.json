        "name": "Berserker",
        "summary": "Melee combatant who utilizes rage to increase prowess",
        "primaryAbility": "Strength",
        "flavorText": "A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. \r\n\r\nA gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. \r\n\r\nFrothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.\r\n\r\nThese berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.\r\n\r\n### Primal Instinct\r\nPeople of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.\r\n\r\nBerserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.\r\n\r\n### A Life of Danger\r\nNot every person deemed \"berserkers\" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.\r\n\r\nTheir courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?\r\n\r\nWhat led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.\r\n",
        "quickBuildText": "You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the mercenary background.\r\n",

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.\r\n\r\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\r\n- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.\r\n- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\r\n\r\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't taken a hostile action or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\r\n\r\nYou can enter a rage a number of times as shown in the Rages column of the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Unarmored Defense\r\n_**Berserker:** 1st level_\r\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\r\n\r\n### Reckless Attack \r\n_**Berserker:** 2nd level_\r\nYou can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Berserker Instincts\r\n_**Berserker:** 2nd level_\r\nYou've honed two instincts, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you hone more at higher levels, as shown in the Berserker Instincts column of the berserker table.\r\n\r\n### Danger Sense\r\n_**Berserker:** 3rd level_\r\nYou gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\r\n\r\n### Berserker Approach\r\n_**Berserker:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level_\r\nYou choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. \r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Berserker:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\n_**Berserker:** 5th level_\r\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Feral Impulse\r\n_**Berserker:** 7th level_\r\nYour instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative checks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\r\n\r\n### Brutal Critical\r\n_**Berserker:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \r\n\r\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Relentless Rage\r\n_**Berserker:** 11th level_\r\nYour rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.\r\n\r\n### Persistent Rage\r\n_**Berserker:** 15th level_\r\nYour rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\r\n\r\n### Indomitable Might\r\n_**Berserker:** 18th level_\r\nIf your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.\r\n\r\n### Primal Champion\r\n_**Berserker:** 20th level_\r\nYou embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can enter rage an unlimited number of times, and entering rage no longer requires your bonus action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Berserker Instincts\r\nThe instincts are presented in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Acklay's Instinct\r\nWhile raging, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws.\r\n\r\n#### Bantha's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nYour carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.\r\n\r\n#### Blurrg's Instinct\r\nWhether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. \r\n\r\n#### Boggdo's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhile raging you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed, though you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.\r\n\r\n#### Chirodactyl's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nWhile raging, you have blindsight to a range of 30 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sound, as long as you aren't deafened.\r\n\r\n#### Dewback's Instinct\r\nChoose three damage types other than true damage. While raging, you have resistance to the chosen damage types.\r\n\r\n#### Fighter's Instinct\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Fyrnock's Instinct\r\nWhile raging, you can use your bonus action to leap up to 30 feet to an empty space you can see. When you land you deal kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier to each creature within 5 feet of where you land. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Hawk's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nYou can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty. You are able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.\r\n\r\n#### Katarn's Instinct\r\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.\r\n\r\n#### Loth-cat's Instinct\r\nWhile you're raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.\r\n\r\n#### Predator's Instinct\r\nYour speed increases by 10 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Rancor's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhile you're raging any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.\r\n\r\n#### Tactician's Instinct\r\nWhen you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to not have advantage on your attack rolls this turn. If you do so, friendly creatures within 5 feet of a hostile creature that is within 5 feet of you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Tracker's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nYou can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.\r\n\r\n#### Terentatek's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhen you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, you can immediately use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the source power's caster. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the target, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack against the target as a part of that reaction.\r\n\r\n#### Varactyl's Instinct\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhile raging, you have advantage on Dexterity checks, your attack rolls can't suffer from disadvantage, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.\r\n",

The rodian's pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.\r\n\r\nSitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her. \r\n\r\nA drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to pound on the approaching tank.\r\n\r\nConsulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future. \r\n\r\n### Strong with the Force\r\nRefraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect. \r\n\r\n### Sage or Sorcerer\r\nConsulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their time in isolation and study.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners � the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities? What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray? \r\n",

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Consular:** 1st level_\r\nIn your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Force Recovery\r\n_**Consular:** 1st level_\r\nYou have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Casting\r\n_**Consular:** 2nd level_\r\nYou gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two Force-Empowered Casting options, located at the end of the class description, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force-Empowered Casting Options of the cnosular table.\r\n\r\nYou can use only one Force-Empowered Casting option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n### Force Shield\r\n_**Consular:** 2nd level_\r\nYou learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Force Affinity\r\n_**Consular:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:\r\n\r\n#### Ashla\r\nWhen you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.\r\n\r\n#### Bendu\r\nYou can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.\r\n\r\n#### Bogan\r\nYour dark side power damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.\r\n\r\n### Consular Tradition\r\n_**Consular:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level_\r\nYou choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. \r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Consular:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### One with the Force\r\n_**Consular:** 20th level_\r\nYour attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\nIf you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Castings\r\nThe castings are presented in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Careful Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.\r\n\r\n#### Distant Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, when you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Extended Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n#### Heightened Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.\r\n\r\n#### Improved Power\r\nWhen you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\r\n\r\nYou can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.\r\n\r\n#### Lingering Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Pinpoint Power \r\nWhen you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Quickened Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\r\n\r\n#### Refocused Power \r\nWhen you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw.\r\n\r\nYou can use Refocused Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.\r\n\r\n#### Seeking Power\r\nIf you miss with a force power that calls for an attack roll, you can spend 2 force points to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll.\r\n\r\nYou can use Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.\r\n\r\n#### Twinned Power\r\nWhen you cast a power that can only have one target and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power's level to choose a second target in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).\r\n",

        "flavorText": "Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. \r\n\r\nInside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. \r\n\r\nA Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.\r\n\r\nEvery machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.\r\n\r\n### Behind the Curtain\r\nWhile perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.\r\n\r\n### Unflappable\r\nIt takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it.

Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?\r\n",

See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or the tools in which you are granted proficiency by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Potent Aptitude\r\n_**Engineer:** 1st level_\r\nYour technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.\r\n\r\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.\r\n\r\nA creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Infuse Item\r\n_**Engineer:** 2nd level_\r\nYou gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nThis bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 15th level.\r\n\r\n### Tool Expertise\r\n_**Engineer:** 2nd level_\r\nYou gain expertise in any tool proficiencies you gain from this class.\r\n\r\n### Engineering Discipline\r\n_**Engineer:** 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level_\r\nYou begin to focus on a specific engineering discipline, which is detailed at the end of the class description. \r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Engineer:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Tech Mastery\r\n_**Engineer:** 20th level_\r\nYour mastery of technology is unrivaled. Your Constitution and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Potent Aptitude left, you regain one use.\r\n",

As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders him unconscious. His blurry vision barely makes out the figure of a masked woman who casually approaches, ready to collect her bounty.\r\n\r\nWith his muscular arms held wide, a grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to his arena opponent just in time to see the Besalisk take a swing. He ducks, punching the four-armed fighter in the gut. Two wild haymakers later, and he stands alone as the gladiatorial champion. \r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, a Republic soldier looks out onto the war zone waging across the frozen surface of Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly then, with a nod to the dozen squad-mates beside him, he charges onto the battlefield. \r\n\r\nFighters combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simple for the thrill of battle.\r\n\r\n### All in a Day's Work\r\nMany fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.\r\n\r\n### Code Red\r\nMost fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "While creating your fighter character, consider where your loyalties lie. You could be part of a formal military, one of countless troopers fighting for your enterprise. Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or have you been at war so long you know of nothing else?\r\n",

First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons).

Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n### Second Wind\r\n_**Fighter:** 1st level_\r\nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Action Surge\r\n_**Fighter:** 2nd level_\r\nYou can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.\r\n\r\n### Combat Superiority\r\n_**Fighter:** 2nd level_\r\nYou learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuvers Known\r\nYou learn one maneuver of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the fighter table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Dice\r\nYou have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the fighter table. This die changes as you gain fighter levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the fighter table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Fighter Strategies\r\n_**Fighter:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've adopted a fighter strategy, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you adopt more at higher levels, as shown in the Strategies Known column of the fighter table.\r\n\r\n### Fighter Specialty\r\n_**Fighter:** 3rd, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level_\r\nYou choose a specialty that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, which is detailed at the end of the class description.\r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Fighter:** 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\n_**Fighter:** 5th level_\r\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Indomitable\r\n_**Fighter:** 9th level_\r\nYou can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Greater Extra Attack\r\n_**Fighter:** 11th level_\r\nYou can attack three times, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you use a bonus action to engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting, you can make two attacks, instead of one.\r\n\r\n### Master of Combat\r\n_**Fighter:** 20th level_\r\nYou are the master of combat. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can attack four times, instead of three times, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Fighter Strategies\r\nThe strategies are presented in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Cover Strategist\r\nYou treat partial cover as one step higher (from one-quarter to half or half to three-quarters). While in cover, your attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter).\r\n\r\n#### Cunning Strategist\r\nChoose two from the following. You can perform each of the chosen options with your bonus action, instead of your action: \r\n- Applying poison\r\n- Dash\r\n- Disengage\r\n- Guard\r\n- Help\r\n- Hide\r\n- Search\r\n- Throwing grenades and setting mines\r\n- While mounted on a controlled beast, having your beast make a single melee attack against a creature within its reach\r\n- While mounted on a vehicle, taking a vehicle action (you can't take the same action twice in one turn)\r\n\r\n#### Enduring Strategist\r\nYou only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits. Lastly, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.\r\n\r\n#### Mastery Strategist\r\nYou've mastered a particular style of fighting. Choose one of the Fighting Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Lightweapon Strategist\r\nYou gain proficiency in all lightweapons. Additionally, you no longer need the ability to cast force powers to learn features that grant lightsaber forms, and you learn one lightsaber form of your choice.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Strategist\r\nYou learn two additional maneuvers. When you complete a short rest, you can replace one of these maneuvers with another one. When you complete a long rest, you can replace both of these maneuvers with other ones.\r\n\r\n#### Skilled Strategist\r\nYou gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.\r\n\r\n#### Style Strategist\r\nYou adopt a second fighting style. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. When you complete a long rest, you can change this style out for another one. \r\n",

He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. \r\n\r\nA sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. \r\n\r\nA zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.\r\n\r\nGuardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.\r\n\r\n### Protector or Destroyer\r\nAn unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.\r\n\r\n### Natural Leaders\r\nThe guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence.

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Guardian:** 1st level_\r\nIn your meditations on the Force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 5 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Channel the Force\r\n_**Guardian:** 1st level_\r\nYou know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.\r\n\r\nSome Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.\r\n\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Cause Harm\r\nAs an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1), or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\n#### Lend Aid\r\nAs a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Strikes\r\n_**Guardian:** 2nd level_\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table. \r\n\r\n### Fighting Style\r\n_**Guardian:** 2nd level_\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.

        "flavorText": "Her vibrostaff a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of blaster bolts, a human springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of pirates on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.\r\n\r\nTaking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.\r\n\r\nMoving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.\r\n\r\n### The Power of Focus\r\nMonks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy�specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.\r\n\r\n### Training and Asceticism\r\nMost monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.\r\n\r\nThe majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.\r\n\r\nFor a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. \r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?\r\n\r\nConsider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?\r\n\r\nAs a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.\r\n",

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Martial Arts\r\n_**Monk:** 1st level_ \r\nYour practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are vibroweapons with which you are proficient that lack the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.\r\n\r\nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:\r\n- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.\r\n- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.\r\n- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.\r\n- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. \r\n- You can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n> ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons\r\n> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the weapon lacks the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.\r\n\r\n### Unarmored Defense\r\n_**Monk:** 1st level_\r\nWhile you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n_**Monk:** 2nd and 11th level_\r\nYour training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the monk table.\r\n\r\nYou can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.\r\n\r\nWhen you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.\r\n\r\nYou use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your focus ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your focus ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a focus feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Focus attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Flurry of Blows\r\nWhen you make your Martial Arts bonus action attack, you can spend 1 focus point to make an additional unarmed strike (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to make two additional unarmed strikes.\r\n\r\n#### Patient Defense\r\nWhen you use your bonus action to Disengage, you can spend 1 focus point to also Dodge (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to Dodge and gain an additional reaction until the start of your next turn. \r\n\r\n#### Step of the Wind\r\nWhen you use your bonus action to Dash, you can spend 1 focus point to double your jump distance for the turn. At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.\r\n\r\n### Monastic Vows\r\n_**Monk:** 2nd level_\r\nYou've sworn two vows, as detailed at the end of the class description. You swear an additional vow at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Unarmored Movement\r\n_**Monk:** 3rd and 9th level_\r\nYour speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.\r\n\r\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\r\n\r\n### Deflect Missiles\r\n_**Monk:** 3rd level_\r\nYou can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are dealt damage by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\r\n\r\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is kinetic, energy, or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.\r\n\r\n### Monastic Order\r\n_**Monk:** 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level_\r\nYou commit yourself to one monastic order, which is detailed at the end of the class description. \r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Monk:** 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Slow Fall\r\n_**Monk:** 4th level_\r\nYou can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\n_**Monk:** 5th level_\r\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Stunning Strike\r\n_**Monk:** 5th level_\r\nYou can interfere with an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Strikes\r\n_**Monk:** 6th level_\r\nYour unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.\r\n\r\n### Evasion\r\n_**Monk:** 7th level_\r\nYour instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\r\n\r\n### Stillness of Mind\r\n_**Monk:** 7th level_\r\nYou can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\r\n\r\n### Purity of Body\r\n_**Monk:** 13th level_\r\nYou are immune to disease and poison and resistant to poison damage.\r\n\r\n### Diamond Soul\r\n_**Monk:** 14th level_\r\nYour mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws, and when you fail a saving throw, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it, taking the new roll.\r\n\r\n### Timeless Vessel\r\n_**Monk:** 15th level_\r\nYour focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, when you complete a short rest, you can expend a Hit Die to remove 1 level of exhaustion or slowed.\r\n\r\n### Empty Body\r\n_**Monk:** 18th level_\r\nYou can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\r\n\r\n### Perfect Self\r\n_**Monk:** 20th level_\r\nYou've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have fewer than 6 focus points remaining, you regain up to 6 focus points.\r\n\r\n### Monastic Vows\r\nThe vows are presented in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Deflection\r\nYou can use your reaction to divert a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage taken by the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Devoted\r\nYou gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n***Force Powers Known.*** You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.\r\n\r\n***Force Points.*** Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.\r\n\r\n***Max Power Level.*** Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n***Forcecasting Ability.*** You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Fate\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. \r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Fighter\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Focused\r\nYou can substitute Strength, Constitution, or Intelligence (chosen when you take this vow) for Wisdom or Charisma for your monk class features, except for other vows and Monastic Tradition features.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Fortitude\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nYou can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be blinded or deafened. \r\n\r\n#### Vow of Freedom\r\nYou ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Intuition\r\nYou can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 10 feet of you due to not being able to see them.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Limber\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to spend 1 focus point. If you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Nemesis\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nAs a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. On a failed save, for the next minute, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it must make an additional Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this feature doesn't restrict its movement for that turn. \r\n\r\nThis feature ends early if you attack another creature, if you target another hostile creature with a power or class feature, if a friendly creature damages the target, if a friendly creature targets it with a power or class feature, or if you target another creature with this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Open Mind\r\nYou gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Additionally, you can spend 1 focus point and 10 minutes meditating on a skill in which you are proficient. If you do so, when you make an ability check with the chosen skill, you can add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to the check. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Precision\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nYour critical hit range with unarmed strikes increases by 1.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Requital\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nWhen you take the Dodge action and an attack made by a creature within 5 feet of you misses you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike against that creature.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Restoration\r\nWhen you would make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 focus point to instead touch a willing creature within your reach. Roll your Martial Arts die. The target gains hit points equal to the amount rolled + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Sentry\r\nYou gain proficiency in light and medium armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing light or medium armor as long as you are not wielding a shield.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Serenity\r\nYour maximum focus increases by an amount equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n#### Vow of Spirit\r\nYou can use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n\r\n#### Vow of the Versatile\r\nWhen you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can instead make a weapon attack with a monk weapon you are wielding, using your Martial Arts die in place of the weapon's damage.\r\n",

A handful of soldiers bursts into the room, but she is already gone � with the data in hand. \r\n\r\nWith a wary eye on the door, a scruffy-looking Duros plays pazaak in a seedy cantina.

        "startingWealthVariant": "7d4 x 100 cr",
        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Expertise\r\n_**Operative:** 1st and 6th level_\r\nChoose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.\r\n\r\nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.\r\n\r\n### Sneak Attack\r\n_**Operative:** 1st level_\r\nYou know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon's damage, and the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. \r\n\r\nYou don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative table.\r\n\r\n### Cunning Action\r\n_**Operative:** 2nd level_\r\nYour quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Operative Exploits\r\n_**Operative:** 2nd level_\r\nYou've adopted two exploits, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional exploit at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Bad Feeling\r\n_**Operative:** 3rd level_\r\nYou have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined. \r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Operative Practice\r\n_**Operative:** 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_\r\nYou choose a practice that you emulate in the exercise of your operative abilities, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your practice choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement\r\n_**Operative:** 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Uncanny Dodge\r\n_**Operative:** 5th level_\r\nWhen an attacker that you can see deals damage to you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.\r\n\r\n### Evasion\r\n_**Operative:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\r\n\r\n### Reliable Talent\r\n_**Operative:** 11th level_\r\nYou have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Ability checks you make that let you add your proficiency bonus gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.\r\n\r\n### Blindsense\r\n_**Operative:** 14th level_\r\nIf you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\r\n\r\n### Slippery Mind\r\n_**Operative:** 15th level_\r\nYou have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \r\n\r\n### Elusive\r\n_**Operative:** 18th level_\r\nYou are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.\r\n\r\n### Stroke of Luck\r\n_**Operative:** 20th level_\r\nYou have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Operative Exploits\r\nThe exploits are presented in alphabetical order. \r\n\r\n#### Commander's Exploit\r\nYou gain proficiency in medium armor.\r\n\r\n#### Explorer's Exploit\r\nYou can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.\r\n\r\n#### Fate's Exploit\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_\r\nWhen you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. \r\n\r\n#### Fighter's Exploit\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Freedom's Exploit\r\nYou ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Guerrilla's Exploit\r\nYou only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits. Lastly, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.\r\n\r\n#### Learner's Exploit\r\nYou gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.\r\n\r\nYou can select this exploit multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.\r\n\r\n#### Mentor's Exploit\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_\r\nOnce per turn, whenever both you and a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you both have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, you can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If you do so, the friendly creature gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\n#### Skill's Exploit\r\nYou learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.\r\n\r\nWhen you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined two times. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nChoose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill's exploit. \r\n\r\n***Aim (Stealth).*** You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.\r\n\r\n***Angle (Perception).*** You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Battle Cry (Intimidation).*** You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Charm (Persuasion).*** You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Confuse Beast (Animal Handling).*** You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the beast cannot take actions or reactions until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Distract (Performance).*** You attempt to distract one beast or humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the next attack roll made against the target before the start of its next turn has advantage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Emulate Predator (Nature).*** You attempt to emulate the sounds of a natural predator of a beast or plant you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Nature) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Feint (Deception).*** You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of \r\n\r\nyour next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Hacktivate (Technology).*** You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Instruct (Investigation).*** You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Intuit (Insight).*** You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can't have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can't have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand).*** You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Precision Strike (Medicine).*** You attempt to strike a pressure point in one humanoid within your reach. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, they are incapacitated until the end of their next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Snare (Survival).*** You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n***Spin (Piloting).*** You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an \r\n\r\nIntelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Study (Lore).*** You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n***Tumble (Acrobatics).*** You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature's reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.\r\n\r\n***Wrestle (Athletics).*** You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n#### Technologist's Exploit\r\nYou learn and can cast one 1st-level tech power once per long rest. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You require use of a wristpad for this power.\r\n\r\nYou can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different power.\r\n\r\n#### Weaponmaster's Exploit\r\nYou gain proficiency in three blasters or vibroweapons that lack the heavy and strength properties.\r\n\r\nYou can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose different weapons.\r\n",

        "flavorText": "An overwhelming horde of tusken raiders bears down on a chiss and her fellow adventurers. She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.\r\n\r\nDeep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.\r\n\r\nA twi'lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape. \r\n\r\nScholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.\r\n\r\n### The Pursuit of Knowledge\r\nA true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.\r\n\r\n### To Learn, To Know\r\nFor scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.\r\n",
        "quickBuildText": "You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the noble background.\r\n",

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Academic Superiority\r\n_**Scholar:** 1st level_\r\nYou learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuvers Known\r\nYou learn one maneuver of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.\r\n\r\nEach time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Dice\r\nYou have three superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the scholar table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. \r\n\r\nYou regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Maneuver Ability\r\nYour maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your maneuver ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Critical Analysis\r\n_**Scholar:** 1st level_\r\nYou are able to analyze a creature, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Critical Analysis ability modifier, which is Intelligence, instead of Strength or Dexterity. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n- When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Critical Analysis ability modifier, which is Intelligence, to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n### Discovery\r\n_**Scholar:** 2nd level_\r\nAs you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills. You master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar table.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.\r\n\r\n### Sage Advice\r\n_**Scholar:** 2nd and 13th level_\r\nYou can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.\r\n\r\nOnce you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

The friendly creatures retain this proficiency for the entire duration instead.\r\n\r\n#### Expert's Advice\r\nWhen you use your Sage Advice feature, the first time each targeted creature makes the chosen skill check, they gain an additional bonus to the roll equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Hardened Mind\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_\r\nYou have advantage on saving throws against illusions and on Intelligence checks to discern them from reality.\r\n\r\nYou also gain resistance to psychic damage.\r\n\r\n#### Lifelong Learning\r\nYou gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.\r\n\r\nYou can select this discovery multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.\r\n\r\n#### Lingering Advice\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_\r\nWhen you use your Sage Advice feature, the targeted creatures retain the benefit from your instruction for the full duration.\r\n\r\n#### Malleable Maneuvering\r\nYou learn two additional maneuvers.

        "primaryAbility": "Dexterity",
        "flavorText": "Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.\r\n\r\nAfter tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.\r\n\r\nGlancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.\r\n\r\nScouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes.\r\n\r\n### Deadly Hunters\r\nWarriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization�humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.\r\n\r\nScouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.\r\n\r\n### Independent Adventurers\r\nThough a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first�and possibly the last�line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.\r\n",
        "creatingText": "As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain�perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. \r\n\r\nWhat's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?\r\n\r\nWhat made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?\r\n",
        "quickBuildText": "You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.\r\n",

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Ranger's Quarry\r\n_**Scout:** 1st, 5th, 9th, and 17th level_\r\nYou learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Ranger's Quarry column of the scout table.\r\n- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it's on the same planet as you.\r\n\r\nYou can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. Beginning at 5th level, you can use your reaction to mark a creature when it enters your line of sight, provided it is within range of your Ranger's Quarry.\r\n\r\nThe duration increases to 8 hours at 9th level and 24 hours at 17th level.\r\n\r\n### Pathfinder\r\n_**Scout:** 1st level_\r\nYou are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You ignore difficult terrain, and when traveling for an hour or more, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group, provided they can see and hear you.\r\n- You can't become lost by unenhanced means.\r\n- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\r\n- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\r\n- When you forage, you find twice as much food.\r\n- You have advantage on Survival checks.\r\n\r\n### Techcasting\r\n_**Scout:** 2nd level_\r\nYou have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Powers Known\r\nYou learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the scout table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n#### Tech Points\r\nYou have a number of tech points equal to your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the scout table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany tech powers can be overcharged, consuming \r\n\r\nmore tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the scout table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast tech powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nIntelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Focus\r\nYou use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a tech focus for your tech powers.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Style\r\n_**Scout:** 2nd level_\r\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. \r\n\r\n### Scout Routine\r\n_**Scout:** 3rd level_\r\nYou've developed one routine, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Routines Known column of the scout table. Your routine has a radius of 5 feet, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Routine Radius column of the scout table.\r\n\r\n### Scout Technique \r\n_**Scout:** 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level_\r\nYou choose to focus on a specific scout technique, which is detailed at the end of the class description.\r\n\r\n### Ability Score Improvement \r\n_**Scout:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_\r\nYou can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\n_**Scout:** 5th level_\r\nYou can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\r\n\r\n### Expertise\r\n_**Scout:** 6th and 14th level_\r\nChoose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.\r\n\r\nAt 14th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.\r\n\r\n### Commando \r\n_**Scout:** 10th level_\r\nYou can take the Dash or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of your turns. Additionally, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. \r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. \r\n\r\nIf you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can no longer be tracked by unenhanced means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\r\n\r\n### Combat Tech\r\n_**Scout:** 14th level_\r\nWhen you use your action to cast a tech power, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Supreme Awareness \r\n_**Scout:** 18th level_\r\nYou gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \r\n\r\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.\r\n\r\n### Foe Slayer \r\n_**Scout:** 20th level_\r\nYou become an unparalleled hunter. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. \r\n\r\n### Scout Routines\r\nThe routines are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple scouts grant the same routine, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefit of your routines.\r\n\r\n#### Adaptability Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose an ability score with a saving throw in which you are not proficient. Until the start of your next turn, you add half your proficiency bonus to saving throws you make with the chosen ability. Alternatively, \r\n\r\nyou can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\n#### Maven's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain resistance to damage from tech powers until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\n#### Mesmer's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to have advantage on saving throws against effects that would incapacitate you or put you to sleep until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\n#### Nomad's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion from unenhanced sources, as well as being naturally adapted to both hot and cold climates. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\n#### Responder's Routine\r\nWhen you roll initiative, you can choose to add your proficiency bonus to the initiative check and have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. Alternatively, you can choose to allow each friendly creature within 5 feet of you to add half your proficiency bonus to the initiative check and have advantage on the first attack roll they make against a creature that has not yet acted.\r\n\r\n#### Sharpshooter's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain a bonus to the first weapon attack roll you make before the start of your next turn equal to your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, you can choose to allow each friendly creature within 5 feet of you to add half your Intelligence modifier to the first weapon attack roll they make before the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Strider's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to have each slowed level only reduce your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0 until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n\r\n#### Warden's Routine\r\nAt the start of each of your turns, you can choose to gain a crawling, climbing, and swimming speed equal to your walking speed until the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to extend this benefit to allies within 5 feet of you.\r\n",

As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.\r\n\r\nThe togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.\r\n\r\nGreen-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine's edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick *force push* and her foe tumbles over the edge.\r\n\r\nSentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.\r\n\r\n### The Middle of the Road\r\nThe sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two. \r\n\r\n### Solitary Action\r\nSentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.\r\n",

Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you an operative tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?\r\n",

        "classFeatureText": "\r\n### Forcecasting\r\n_**Sentinel:** 1st level_\r\nIn your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.\r\n\r\n#### Force Powers Known\r\nYou learn 7 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the sentinel table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your sentinel level x 3, as shown in the Force Points column of the sentinel table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the sentinel table.\r\n\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Led by the Force\r\n_**Sentinel:** 1st level_\r\nYou can add half your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n### Force-Empowered Self\r\n_**Sentinel:** 2nd level_\r\nYour training allows you to harness the mystical energy of the Force throughout your body. You learn three effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. Each effect costs 1 force point and uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You can only use each effect once per round.\r\n\r\n#### Deflection\r\nWhen you are the target of an attack, you can roll a Kinetic Combat die and add it to your AC (no action required). You can do so before or after the attack is made, but you must choose to do so before the GM determines if the attack hits.\r\n\r\n#### Double Strike\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage of the same type equal to the amount rolled.\r\n\r\n#### Slow Time\r\nWhen you move on your turn, you can roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of your turn.\r\n\r\n### Sentinel Ideals\r\n_**Sentinel:** 2nd level_\r\nYou adopt ideals that exemplify your bond with the Force.

If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy. For the next minute, when a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they take half the normal weapon damage, and when a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw, they treat the damage as if you had rolled the maximum.\r\n\r\n#### Ideal of the Titan\r\nYou gain proficiency in medium armor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy.
