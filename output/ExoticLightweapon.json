If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature takes additional damage of the same type at the start of its next turn equal to your governing ability modifier.</p>\n<h3>Dexterity 11</h3>\n<p>A weapon with this property requires more skill to control.
