                    "value": "<p>Protocol droids are programmed mostly for etiquette, and are often used as translators between sentients or between sentients and computers. They are generally designed to look like the sentients they serve; for example, 3PO-series protocol droids are humanoid.They possess knowledge about various cultures and customs, both to advise those for whom they were working, and to ensure their own behavior is diplomatic and culturally sensitive.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Protocol droids constructed around 4000 BBY (around the time of the Great Sith War and the Jedi Civil War) were frequently engineered with certain behavioral shifts set to occur whenever another design-generation was reached. A number of these droids underwent radical changes with each new generationâ€”for example, when a C7-model droid supplanted the C6 variety. Each numeric \"jump\" in sequence could have had wide-ranging changes in functionality and temperament during that historical period.<strong><em>Programming Units.</strong></em> Cybot Galactica, the most famous and successful manufacturer of protocol droids, outfit them with SyntheTech AA-1 VerboBrains to give their droids personalities with emotions and the ability to learn and grow very similar to organic beings. The 3PO unit possesses a TranLang III communications module that can reproduce over six million languages, as well as reproduce any sound it picks up. Linguistic modules are also used to improve their speech functions. Some models, such as the pricey E-3POs, also include the TechSpan I module, making it possible to interface with Imperial networks and undocumented technologies of Imperial subcontractors.</p>\n<p>The 3PO-series protocol droid is a Human-cyborg relations protocol droid produced by Cybot Galactica.  They are equipped with a TranLang III communication module, and as a result are fluent in over 6 million forms of communication. The model series has very similar aesthetic design in its casing to other Cybot Galactica droid model series such as the TC-series, 3PX-series, and 5YQ-series protocol droids.<strong><em>0-0-0.</strong></em> The Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix is a droid personality matrix that was created centuries before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The matrix is considered incredibly dangerous when placed into its designed droid body: a protocol droid. The matrix, when inserted into a protocol droid, turns it into an assassin droid that specializes in torture.It was quarantined on Quarantine World III in Kallidahin Space for centuries before it was stolen by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra during the Galactic Civil War.</p>"

They are mounted on many vehicles, starfighters, and starships.  Other turrets are mounted on the ground, and can be both manned and un-manned. Weapons mounted on turrets included laser cannons and other types of projectile cannons.</p>\n<p>Manufactured by Atgar SpaceDefense Corporation, the 1.4 FD P-Tower is a light laser cannon employed as a fixed emplacement anti-vehicle weapon. It is designed to target a variety of enemy vehicles, including repulsortanks and landspeeders, although it has difficulty targeting fast-moving vehicles. The unit is quick to produce and inexpensive.The main bulk of the weapon is a 2.8 meter high energy dish that has sixteen micropower routers spaced evenly along the outer edge, and eight power conversion cells along the interior of the dish. Targeting sensors are placed on the upper edge of the dish, and a single light laser cannon emanates from the center of the dish. To fire the weapon, energy is fed directly into each micropower router which holds the charge until the firing computer registers that the Energy Conversion Point had been achieved. The power conversion cells around the dish glows once the weapon is primed to fire. At that point, the firing computer channels the energy from the routers into the main power converter located at the center of the dish, firing the weapon. The energy beam moves through the discharge barrel, into the galven circuitry and through the focusing lens to produce a low-power beam that is effective against repulsorcraft, landspeeders, and airspeeders.The 1.4 FD P-Tower utilizes an Atgar C-6 battery, which only retains enough power for eight shots before needing to be replaced. The battery is easy to replace when handled by a skilled technician. When hooked up to a power generator, the weapon has unlimited fire capability. The weapon also suffers from a low fire rate, and requires ten seconds to build up an adequate charge.  The visible dish was also a tempting target for opponents, although the weapon itself is protected by light armor plating.</p>"

They are generally designed to look like the sentients they serve; for example, 3PO-series protocol droids are humanoid.They possess knowledge about various cultures and customs, both to advise those for whom they were working, and to ensure their own behavior is diplomatic and culturally sensitive.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Protocol droids constructed around 4000 BBY (around the time of the Great Sith War and the Jedi Civil War) were frequently engineered with certain behavioral shifts set to occur whenever another design-generation was reached. A number of these droids underwent radical changes with each new generationâ€”for example, when a C7-model droid supplanted the C6 variety. Each numeric \"jump\" in sequence could have had wide-ranging changes in functionality and temperament during that historical period.<strong><em>Programming Units.</strong></em> Cybot Galactica, the most famous and successful manufacturer of protocol droids, outfit them with SyntheTech AA-1 VerboBrains to give their droids personalities with emotions and the ability to learn and grow very similar to organic beings. The 3PO unit possesses a TranLang III communications module that can reproduce over six million languages, as well as reproduce any sound it picks up. Linguistic modules are also used to improve their speech functions. Some models, such as the pricey E-3POs, also include the TechSpan I module, making it possible to interface with Imperial networks and undocumented technologies of Imperial subcontractors.</p>\n<p>The 3PO-series protocol droid is a Human-cyborg relations protocol droid produced by Cybot Galactica.  They are equipped with a TranLang III communication module, and as a result are fluent in over 6 million forms of communication. The model series has very similar aesthetic design in its casing to other Cybot Galactica droid model series such as the TC-series, 3PX-series, and 5YQ-series protocol droids.<strong><em>0-0-0.</strong></em> The Triple-Zero protocol personality matrix is a droid personality matrix that was created centuries before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The matrix is considered incredibly dangerous when placed into its designed droid body: a protocol droid. The matrix, when inserted into a protocol droid, turns it into an assassin droid that specializes in torture.It was quarantined on Quarantine World III in Kallidahin Space for centuries before it was stolen by the rogue archaeologist Doctor Aphra during the Galactic Civil War.</p>"

It iscommonly used for reconnaissance missions as well as rapid transportation in combat zones. They were capable of reaching speeds up to and beyond five hundred kilometers per hour, and had a flight ceiling of twenty-five meters. 74-Zs were the military variant of the civilian 74-Y. They were controlled by handlebars located towards the front of the vehicle, and foot pedals slung underneath adjusted speed and altitude.The highly maneuverable vehicles were equipped with sensor and communications devices located between the handlebars, including a comlink and a comlink-jamming device. The speeder was equipped with terrain-following sensors that linked up with the HUD in the driver's helmet. They were armed with a forward rotating blaster cannon for combat.They were also equipped with a very powerful boost that could propel them over vast distances in a shorter amount of time. In addition, the 74-Z was stripped down to just its fundamental components, namely the engine and steering vane, in order to increase its overall speed, and as such a single, scaled-down, forward-facing blaster cannon was fixed on the undercarriage. </p>"

It is equipped with a single seat for a pilot, as well as a repeating blaster cannon and mortar launcher, and is 3.2 meters tall and 2.9 meters long,. Also known as the Republic scout walker, the AT-RT was used mainly during the Clone Wars by Advanced Recon Force troopers. It was the precursor to both the All Terrain Defense Pod and the All Terrain Scout Transport. During the Galactic Civil War, these walkers were adopted by both the Galactic Empire, who used Scout troopers to man the vehicles, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic, who upgraded them to compete with the advancements of the Empire.The AT-RT's were usually used for a variety of missions including ground support, police support, civil defense, and post-battle cleanup efforts. They occasionally took up position on the front lines of ground battles when difficult terrain prevented the use of larger vehicles.</p>"

The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they are essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and can quickly eliminate small threats that evade an AT-AT's barrage. The walker is commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and is piloted by two AT-ST drivers.Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power are significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems are only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor can repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor does not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module can destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees can cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.The modular design of the AT-ST allows for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters such as mortar launchers attached to the command pod.</p>"

The aiwhas were among those who were adapted using the Kaminoans' advanced cloning technologies, and became biological curiosities used as mounts to traverse Kamino's endless ocean.

Opportunistic hunters as well as scavengers, these wolflike canines would attack virtually anything smaller than themselves (such as scurriers) and would band together in packs to bring down rontos, eopies, and similar creatures.Strong, horny beaks on their jaws assisted in the breaking of thick skeletons, while long, tufted tails helped to counterbalance the body and dissipate heat. Anoobas could vary in weight from 20 to 45 kilogramsâ€”males being larger than femalesâ€”and often banded into packs of ten to twelve. These units were dominated by an alpha male and alpha female, and it was not uncommon to see entire packs waiting alongside podrace courses for an easy meal.Like the winged urusai, accounts tell of anoobas being so engorged on meals that they are unable to move. This may be due in part to the fact that anooba mothers fed their young, born three to four at a time, through regurgitation.<strong><em>Domestication.</strong></em> Anoobas were also known to be, like the massiff, domesticated by Tatooine's Tusken Raiders as pets and guard animals.<strong><em>Off-World.</strong></em> Packs of escaped, adaptable anoobas imported from Tatooine roamed Coruscant alleys looking for prey. As a result, nocturnal foot traffic in certain areas was highly risky. Anoobas on Coruscant were known to howl at the planet's moons. Anoobas were sometimes caught in packs and used as gladiatorial fighting animals, for which they were given a shock collar to control their behavior.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Warm-blooded avians that live on Cerea, the species is carnivorous and far taller than the sentient Cereans. </p>"

Often, they were installed at the entrances to hidden bases, onboard capital ships, or near personal valuables.In the later stages of the Clone Wars, portable autoturrets were used by both the Grand Army of the Republiic and the Separatist Droid Army for covering fire or to reinforce the defense of field command posts.

They are mounted on many vehicles, starfighters, and starships.  Other turrets are mounted on the ground, and can be both manned and un-manned. Weapons mounted on turrets included laser cannons and other types of projectile cannons.</p>\n<p>Sentry guns come in a wide variety of different sizes, yields, and types. These weapons can typically be found near high-value areas such as detention cells, command centers, and laboratories. For best results, they are placed in areas such as corners, above security doors, or other positions that afford them a wide field of fire. Sentry guns are usually linked to the central security system, but can be operated manually by remote. Once activated, these turrets may use active sensors and preprogrammed criteria to identify threats and fire upon any hostiles they encounter.  Sentry guns are also used on starships and may automatically engage nearby hostiles and are linked to the ship's central security system.  Some sentry guns include targeting sensors that seek out energy signatures from enemy weapons, with built-in computers to determine which targets pose the most immediate threat.</p>"

One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B1 battle droids, also referred to as standard battle droids, are the most widely-used battle droids manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop and were the successor to the OOM-series battle droids. The B1 battle droid sees extensive service as the mainlines soldiers due to their cheap, mass produced nature. The B1-X model serves as an officer unit.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Early versions of the model required the use of a Central Control Computer, but despite these weaknesses they saw extensive service as the mainlines soldier of the Trade Federation's mechanized droid army.  Despite their limitations and despite battle droids being outlawed under the Empire, B1 battle droids continued to see use through Separatist holdouts and the black market during the Imperial Era.</p>"

One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B1 battle droids, also referred to as standard battle droids, are the most widely-used battle droids manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop and were the successor to the OOM-series battle droids. The B1 battle droid sees extensive service as the mainlines soldiers due to their cheap, mass produced nature. The B1-X model serves as an officer unit.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Early versions of the model required the use of a Central Control Computer, but despite these weaknesses they saw extensive service as the mainlines soldier of the Trade Federation's mechanized droid army.  Despite their limitations and despite battle droids being outlawed under the Empire, B1 battle droids continued to see use through Separatist holdouts and the black market during the Imperial Era.</p>"

One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B1 battle droids, also referred to as standard battle droids, are the most widely-used battle droids manufactured by Baktoid Combat Automata and Baktoid Armor Workshop and were the successor to the OOM-series battle droids. The B1 battle droid sees extensive service as the mainlines soldiers due to their cheap, mass produced nature. The B1-X model serves as an officer unit.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Early versions of the model required the use of a Central Control Computer, but despite these weaknesses they saw extensive service as the mainlines soldier of the Trade Federation's mechanized droid army.  Despite their limitations and despite battle droids being outlawed under the Empire, B1 battle droids continued to see use through Separatist holdouts and the black market during the Imperial Era.</p>"

One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B2 super battle droids were an advanced battle droid used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate. The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground as seen at the Battle of Teth. The B2-HA super battle droid was a variant of the B2 equipped with a cannon arm that could fire homing rockets.</p>"

One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B2 super battle droids were an advanced battle droid used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate. The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground as seen at the Battle of Teth. The B2-HA super battle droid was a variant of the B2 equipped with a cannon arm that could fire homing rockets.</p>"

These compact droids used tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed compartments. Many starfighters relied on astromech copilots to control flight and power distribution systems. Sitting in an astromech socket exposed to space, the droid, in addition to its piloting duties, could calculate hyperspace jumps and perform simple repairs.Most astromechs were only able to communicate in writing, conveyed via another computer system, or through a special code of clicks, bleeps, and similar sounds, known as binary. However, certain other droids, such as C-3PO, could understand the binary code of astromechs, and often translated from binary to other languages.</p>\n<p>The BB series astromech droid was a model of astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton and active during the era of the cold war, featuring a spherical body that allowed the droid to roll in any direction, with a head usually atop the body but not meant to be permanently physically attached to it (which would inhibit the droid's ability to roll around). Like earlier astromechs, the BB unit could fit into the droid socket of a starfighter.</p>"

These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>The BX series commando droid was an elite battle droid model made for stealth assignments. Equipped with a stealth field generator, they were perfectly designed for espionage.They had the same operating abilities as B1 battle droids, with the addition of infiltration software. This, along with their humanoid shape, gave them the unique ability to fit into human-sized armor. In addition to this, the droids were capable of modulating their voices to match that of others, though they could not accurately copy their mannerisms or vocabulary, nor respond properly to unexpected situations outside of combatBX-series droid commandos were designed to accomplish tasks that an overwhelming force of droids could not.

                    "value": "<p>Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>B2 super battle droids were an advanced battle droid used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Like the updated B1s used by the Confederacy, they did not require a command system to operate, which gave the droids limited independence. Another improvement was their thick armor casing, which contained their fragile sensors. However, B2s were designed with simple processors, limiting their ability to formulate strategies. As a result, they relied on organic commanders or tactical droids in order to effectively operate. The B2 was much stronger than the B1s, with enough strength to lift a clone trooper off the ground as seen at the Battle of Teth. The B2-HA super battle droid was a variant of the B2 equipped with a cannon arm that could fire homing rockets.</p>"

They are known to have two heads that sit atop long, fluid necks. The heads hold a pair of yellow slitted eyes. There were some varieties of these beasts that have more than two heads.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> When left to their own devices, these beasts are mindless and shy creatures-a sharp contrast to their fearsome appearance. Battle hydras are known to be solitary animals that hunt alone. They spend most time aloft where they ride thermal currents in search of prey or threats. When prey is spotted, the battle hydra dives through the air, snapping with multiple jaws as well as their poisoned stinger. Once prey succumbs to either the attack or poison, the beast takes the corpse back to its lair where it is torn apart and devoured. These animals are, however, susceptible to influence or commands from Force-sensitive dark side users. Many of battle hydras have been used as personal shocktroopers for these dark-lords. Battle hydras are known to be particularly attracted to sites that are strong in the dark side of the Force. It is believed that perhaps these beasts draw some form of nourishment from these locations.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Native to Tatooine, the womp rat is a breed of rodent, and considered hairy, monstrous pests. They moved on four legs tipped with three-clawed paws, and had long tails and ears. Typically not much bigger than two meters, they possessed big, sharp fangs used to seize prey, and had large, yellow eyes.Womp rats were not timid creatures, hunting in packs and using their fangs to seize prey. When alone, a single womp rat was known to devour the garbage left by moisture farmers. When traveling in packs of up to 20 individuals, Womp Rats were known to overwhelm larger prey items, such as Dewbacks and Banthas. When they bite, their teeth set in and the animals will not release their hold, even if they are killed. There were three species of womp rats: ones that lived in Beggar's Canyon, ones that lived in the Jundland Wastes, and swamp womp rats. The Jundland Wastes womp rat appeared shortly after Imperials arrived on Tatooine, and some have speculated it was a mutated form of the Beggar's Canyon womp rat, affected by chemicals from Imperial waste dumps. Some of its mutations include a larger size, slower reproduction rate, and lower numbers than Beggar's Canyon womp rat. Their ears are also elongated and winglike. Another variety, the swamp womp rat, was found on a few fringe worlds as well as on Cularin.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>A homicidal assassin droid created by the Galactic Empire's Tarkin Initiative, the BT-1 model is designed to look like an astromech droid in order to fool others.

Stoic and strong, they are used for everything from agricultural labor to war; the Twi'lek Resistance on Ryloth rode blurrgs in battle during the Battle of Ryloth, where they were used at the final offensive against Separatist forces in Lessu, charging at droid troops with the Grand Army of the Republic's Lightning Squadron.The blurrg's huge mouth could chew through almost anything edible, which made it perfect for clearing savanna grass, weeds, and saplings. Blurrgs were strong, fast, but stupidâ€”so much so that they walked right into small trees, knocking them down. The egg-laying creatures usually produced 5 or 6 babies at a time. In their early years babies stayed very close to their mothers for protection from Boar-wolves. Blurrgs communicated through a series of roars. They are also vicious when driven to a fury, and are reputedly noisy when agitated.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>About 3 meters tall; and having sharp teeth, a humped back, and two tusks; boar-wolves live on Endor's moon.</p>"

These compact droids used tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed compartments. Many starfighters relied on astromech copilots to control flight and power distribution systems. Sitting in an astromech socket exposed to space, the droid, in addition to its piloting duties, could calculate hyperspace jumps and perform simple repairs.Most astromechs were only able to communicate in writing, conveyed via another computer system, or through a special code of clicks, bleeps, and similar sounds, known as binary. However, certain other droids, such as C-3PO, could understand the binary code of astromechs, and often translated from binary to other languages.</p>\n<p>The C1 series astromech droid, was a model of C-series astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton. They were used during the Clone Warsand the reign of the Galactic Empire, though by then they were considered antiques and had passed their manufacturer's expiry date a few decades prior. They had three mechanical arms to manipulate objects with, and featured an electrical arc welder.</p>"

Many cantinas provid live entertainment in the form of musicians, dancers, or fighters. Gambling is also popular in these locales. The main attractions, however, are the beverages served by mixologists or automixers, and the opportunity to meet friends or business associates (illicit or otherwise).Cantinas are generally poorly lit and crowded. They are dangerous centers of criminal activity, and it is not uncommon for patrons to be maimed or killed within the walls, without so much as a flinch from the staff or the other patrons.

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Clodhoppers are omnivorous, dim-witted, flightless avians from Naboo that are rarely more than three feet tall.  They feed in swarms.</p>"

The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra.

They are mounted on many vehicles, starfighters, and starships.  Other turrets are mounted on the ground, and can be both manned and un-manned. Weapons mounted on turrets included laser cannons and other types of projectile cannons.</p>\n<p>Manufactured by Golan Arms, the DF.9 is a fixed emplacement anti-infantry weapon. It incorporates a single DF.9 laser cannon mounted atop a four-meter tall cylindrical housing composed of heavily-armored durasteel, with proton-shielding that is resistant to close-quarters blaster fire. The tower features a front access panel, and an upper observation hatch.The turreted laser cannon employs precision targeting computers and has an optimal rang of three kilometers, although the laser cannon is capable of hitting targets at a distance of sixteen kilometers at the cost of decreased accuracy. The DF.9 is capable of firing a shot every three seconds, with the impact of the energy beam scattering explosive energy and producing a secondary blast of radiation with an eight-meter radius impact point that can effectively destroy entire squads of soldiers. Skilled gunners can use the DF.9's accuracy to effectively disable army support systems and light vehicles, and it is devastating to foot soldiers and a threat to vehicles such as the All Terrain Scout Transport.The DF.9 is best used in conjunction with other similar units and anti-vehicle lasers to defend military bases, spaceports and other strategic installations. It can be installed on multiple terrain types. The nature of the DF.9's fixed emplacement means that the unit is not able to be moved easily.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>The DSD1 dwarf spider droid, also known as the burrowing spider droid because it was first used to destroy opposition in narrow mine shafts, is a battle droid manufactured by the Commerce Guild to support the cause of the Separatists, and also used to punish customers who decline to pay their taxes to the Commerce Guild.<strong><em>Characteristics.</strong></em> The DSD1 is similar in function to a typical combat vehicle. Its main weapon is a long central blaster cannon mounted on its dome that is capable of firing either rapid anti-personnel rounds, or slower high-intensity blasts that can destroy light vehicles. The droid's small frame and four all-terrain legs make it suitable for warfare in dangerous mines, and the adjustable legs lets it attain better elevation for the blaster cannon. Its legs are able to walk straight up and down walls and narrow cliffsides. However, because of the fixed laser cannon, it can not turn around to track enemies, thus making it inferior to speedy targets. Also, the length of this cannon sometimes hinders it in confined areas.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> The droid communicates in a beeping language similar to Binary. It seems to have basic emotions, such as frustration. They do not do anything that they predict will harm themselves.<strong><em>After the Clone Wars.</strong></em>  Though most Separatist war vehicles were deactivated after the end of the Clone Wars, the dwarf spider droids were recommissioned through Imperial command and used by the Galactic Empire to enforce the submission of former Separatist worlds, fighting against the remnants of the very government that once used them, with the Stormtrooper Corps using the droids as their mechanical attack dogs. They would remain utilized throughout the Empire's reign, and it was not uncommon to see these droids alongside stormtroopers at Imperial checkpoints.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>While most Jedi would lose their solid form and become one with the Force upon their death, some had learned a technique to retain their own identities separate from the Force for a time. Those individuals could linger in the physical world in the form of \"Force Spirits,\" nonphysical entities that exhibited most traits and abilities they had in life. According to the knowledge contained in Asli Krimsan's holocron, that feat could be achieved by sublimating one's organic cells into a state of pure energy.In its \"normal\" state, a Force Spirit could only interact with other noncorporeal entities. In order to be heard or seen by the living, the Spirit had to manifest itself. There were different types of manifestation. On a basic level, a Force ghost could appear as a floating, milky gray mass of energy that lacked distinctive features. But it could also manifest itself as the exact image of the dead being during their lifetime, only transparent and emitting a bluish glow. While it could appear to anyone it wished, a spirit could not choose to become audible or visible to only some beings and not the others, since the ability to perceive the manifestation depended on the beholder's strength in the Force. While many Force ghosts could appear as a vision of their former selves unmarked by injury or disease, others still bore the marks of what killed them. Normally, force spirits could neither harm nor be harmed by physical entities, due to their spiritual nature. For the same reason, they could pass through solid matter effortlessly and were never hampered in their movements. While some spirits would simulate the walk of the living beings, subject to gravity, others would hover and drift above ground level. However, in some cases, a spirit could acquire temporary solidity by drawing on a living creature's link with the Force, which allowed it to actually touch the material world for a time. A manifested spirit could wield Force powers, although not all of them. It also had the ability to travel instantaneously to any point in the galaxy by force of will, as long as the spirit was familiar with that place. </p>\n<p>Some incredibly powerful dark force users can bind themselves to a location and physcially manifest and remain incredibly potent over a limited geographic area, such as a cave, copse, or abandoned city.  This location is their lair.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a Dark Lord Spirit can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:- Dark Lord Spirit casts the <em>coerce mind</em> power on every creature of his choice in the lair.  It needn't see each one, but it must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. It issues the same command to all the targets.- Dark Lord Spirit casts the <em>darness</em> power four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the power.  It doesn't need to concentrate on the powers, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.#### Regional Effects- The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with lizards, poisonous snakes, and other venoumous beasts.- Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become violent and crazed -- even creatures that are normally docile.- Intelligent creatures within half of a mile of the lair frequently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse.If the Dark Lord Spirit dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>"

Those individuals could linger in the physical world in the form of \"Force Spirits,\" nonphysical entities that exhibited most traits and abilities they had in life. According to the knowledge contained in Asli Krimsan's holocron, that feat could be achieved by sublimating one's organic cells into a state of pure energy.In its \"normal\" state, a Force Spirit could only interact with other noncorporeal entities. In order to be heard or seen by the living, the Spirit had to manifest itself. There were different types of manifestation. On a basic level, a Force ghost could appear as a floating, milky gray mass of energy that lacked distinctive features. But it could also manifest itself as the exact image of the dead being during their lifetime, only transparent and emitting a bluish glow. While it could appear to anyone it wished, a spirit could not choose to become audible or visible to only some beings and not the others, since the ability to perceive the manifestation depended on the beholder's strength in the Force. While many Force ghosts could appear as a vision of their former selves unmarked by injury or disease, others still bore the marks of what killed them. Normally, force spirits could neither harm nor be harmed by physical entities, due to their spiritual nature. For the same reason, they could pass through solid matter effortlessly and were never hampered in their movements. While some spirits would simulate the walk of the living beings, subject to gravity, others would hover and drift above ground level. However, in some cases, a spirit could acquire temporary solidity by drawing on a living creature's link with the Force, which allowed it to actually touch the material world for a time. A manifested spirit could wield Force powers, although not all of them. It also had the ability to travel instantaneously to any point in the galaxy by force of will, as long as the spirit was familiar with that place. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

Operating under Imperial Intelligence, they served as protective details and bodyguards for significant Imperial officers as well as special-assignment commandos. Death troopers were trained in unarmed combat, heavy weapons, demolitions, and marksmanship. They were experts at covering their tracks, leaving little to no evidence of their missions.Stormtrooper candidates who excelled at their training were reassigned to the advanced death trooper camp on Scarif. They were required to exceed traditional stormtrooper standards, including height and weight, and had to meet certain ideological standards. The candidates were also subjected to a battery of physical tests and classified surgical enhancements as well as more rigorous training than standard stormtroopers. They wore black suits of armor that was much more advanced than standard stormtrooper armor. Their helmet had vocal scramblers, micro-motion sensors, targeting systems, and heads-up displays with data on enemy and friendly positions on the battlefield to give them total situational awareness. Their armor was also covered by a spray polymer called reflec, which warped electromagnetic signals commonly found in sensor arrays, making them well suited for stealth operations. Death troopers were equipped with a variety of weapons depending on their specialities including the SE-14r light repeating blasters, E-11Ds, DLT-19D heavy blaster rifles, C-25 fragmentation grenades and Sonic Imploders.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>Melee destroyer droids are an early variation of the Trade Federation droideka. Developed as the ultimate melee unit, the Melee Destroyer Droid is tougher than the standard droidekas but utilizes weaker shields. The primary weapon of the grapple droideka is its lethal mechanical claws. </p>"

                    "value": "<p>Dewbacks were large, four-legged, omnivorous, cold-blooded reptiles native to the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As such, they were well-adapted to the harsh desert climate. This and the fact that they could be easily domesticated made them commonly employed as beasts of burden by both the inhabitants of the desert planet and the off-worlders wandering its dunes. <strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> While they had a reputation for being solitary animals, wild dewbacks were also known to roam the seemingly endless deserts of Tatooine in single-file packs of two to five, searching for food and moisture during the day. To retain warmth and conserve energy, the dewbacks huddled together at night. The dew that accumulated on their backs during the night was both a source of moisture in the morning and the origin of the species's name.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Adult dewbacks stood at 1.3 to 2.1 meters in height and could reach lengths of 2 to 3 meters. Though most of them were green, dewbacks with red, brown, gray and most rarely blue scales were known to exist. It was common for these scales to have a mottled or camouflage pattern to them. The special melanins contained within a dewback's hide, which cut down on the glare from the twin suns of Tatoo I and Tatoo II, preserved vital fluids and gave it the ability to go days without water and endure the extreme heat.<strong><em>Mounts.</strong></em> Dewbacks were sold by Rothana Heavy Engineering to be used as mounts by Imperial troops. They were bundled in a herd of six animals and cost 16000 credits. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Dewbacks were large, four-legged, omnivorous, cold-blooded reptiles native to the Dune Sea of Tatooine. As such, they were well-adapted to the harsh desert climate. This and the fact that they could be easily domesticated made them commonly employed as beasts of burden by both the inhabitants of the desert planet and the off-worlders wandering its dunes. <strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> While they had a reputation for being solitary animals, wild dewbacks were also known to roam the seemingly endless deserts of Tatooine in single-file packs of two to five, searching for food and moisture during the day. To retain warmth and conserve energy, the dewbacks huddled together at night. The dew that accumulated on their backs during the night was both a source of moisture in the morning and the origin of the species's name.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Adult dewbacks stood at 1.3 to 2.1 meters in height and could reach lengths of 2 to 3 meters. Though most of them were green, dewbacks with red, brown, gray and most rarely blue scales were known to exist. It was common for these scales to have a mottled or camouflage pattern to them. The special melanins contained within a dewback's hide, which cut down on the glare from the twin suns of Tatoo I and Tatoo II, preserved vital fluids and gave it the ability to go days without water and endure the extreme heat.<strong><em>Mounts.</strong></em> Dewbacks were sold by Rothana Heavy Engineering to be used as mounts by Imperial troops. They were bundled in a herd of six animals and cost 16000 credits. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Dianoga were large cephalopods, capable of growing up to ten meters in length, though most specimens grew to approximately five or six meters. They had a single eyestalk protruding from their mollusk-like bodies, and seven suckered tentacles surrounding a fanged maw containing a sharp serrated probe.Their bodies would become transparent when unfed, and, conversely, were known to change to reflect the color of the food they had eaten. This was achieved by diverting small portions of digested food into a series of ducts underneath the creature's skin, which would appear to affect the color of the dianoga's flesh.Over many millennia, dianoga migrated from Vodran by stowing away aboard garbage ships in their microscopic larval forms, and could be commonly found in trash compactors, garbage pits, and sewers across the galaxy, living off any present organic matter. They were primarily scavengers, and only posed a threat to living creatures when starving or threatened. Because of their penchant for living in and feeding on organic waste, dianoga were sometimes referred to as garbage squids, sewage squids, or trash monsters.Smaller dianoga were known to crawl out of toilets. Despite this, they could prove useful, since they served to rid waste of biological material, leaving behind salvageable minerals and metals. Only when a dianoga grew too large was it usually considered a threat, especially in urban areas.  However, the presence of a single dianoga was often cause for alarm, since the creatures were self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and could quickly multiply to pose a larger problem.<strong><em>Dianoga's Lair.</strong></em> A dianoga can often be found in trash compactors, garbage pits, sewers, water treatment facilities, and the like, throughout the galaxy.  Alternatively, some Dianoga's still live in natural environments such lakes and swamps.A dianoga knows its territory like the back of its tentacle, and can use the terrain to it's advantage.  When found in a confined setting with lots of refuse, such as in a garbage compactor, dianoga's are at their most deadly.  A dianoga encountered in it's lair has a challenge rating 1 higher than otherwise indicated.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties, the dianoga can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dianoga cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:- The water within 60 feet of the dianoga is filled with rippling waves.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature moves into that area or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.- The dianoga retreats into the water and becomes invisible until initiative count 20 on the next turn or until the dianoga attacks, whichever comes first.- The dianoga causes the effects of the <em>Burst</em> power cast by a 1st level caster at any point it can see within the lair.#### Regional Effects- The area within 120 feet of the lair (if not separated from the lair by walls) is filled with a odorous mist, lightly obscuring the area.

                    "value": "<p>Dianoga were large cephalopods, capable of growing up to ten meters in length, though most specimens grew to approximately five or six meters. They had a single eyestalk protruding from their mollusk-like bodies, and seven suckered tentacles surrounding a fanged maw containing a sharp serrated probe.Their bodies would become transparent when unfed, and, conversely, were known to change to reflect the color of the food they had eaten. This was achieved by diverting small portions of digested food into a series of ducts underneath the creature's skin, which would appear to affect the color of the dianoga's flesh.Over many millennia, dianoga migrated from Vodran by stowing away aboard garbage ships in their microscopic larval forms, and could be commonly found in trash compactors, garbage pits, and sewers across the galaxy, living off any present organic matter. They were primarily scavengers, and only posed a threat to living creatures when starving or threatened. Because of their penchant for living in and feeding on organic waste, dianoga were sometimes referred to as garbage squids, sewage squids, or trash monsters.Smaller dianoga were known to crawl out of toilets. Despite this, they could prove useful, since they served to rid waste of biological material, leaving behind salvageable minerals and metals. Only when a dianoga grew too large was it usually considered a threat, especially in urban areas.  However, the presence of a single dianoga was often cause for alarm, since the creatures were self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, and could quickly multiply to pose a larger problem.<strong><em>Dianoga's Lair.</strong></em> A dianoga can often be found in trash compactors, garbage pits, sewers, water treatment facilities, and the like, throughout the galaxy.  Alternatively, some Dianoga's still live in natural environments such lakes and swamps.A dianoga knows its territory like the back of its tentacle, and can use the terrain to it's advantage.  When found in a confined setting with lots of refuse, such as in a garbage compactor, dianoga's are at their most deadly.  A dianoga encountered in it's lair has a challenge rating 1 higher than otherwise indicated.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties, the dianoga can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dianoga cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:- The water within 60 feet of the dianoga is filled with rippling waves.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature moves into that area or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.- The dianoga retreats into the water and becomes invisible until initiative count 20 on the next turn or until the dianoga attacks, whichever comes first.- The dianoga causes the effects of the <em>Burst</em> power cast by a 1st level caster at any point it can see within the lair.#### Regional Effects- The area within 120 feet of the lair (if not separated from the lair by walls) is filled with a odorous mist, lightly obscuring the area.  The mist can be cleared away, for example, by a light wind, if the lair is not enclosed.- The area surrounding the lair is permeated by the stench of death and decay.  If a creature spends as least 1 hour within 500 feet of the lair (if not separated from the lair by walls), the creature must succeed a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned.  A short rest in clean air will remove this poisoned condition.- Molds and fungi do not grow on surfaces within 500 feet of the lair, even where they would normally find purchase.- There are no obviously organic surfaces or creatures within 120 feet of the lair.If the Dianoga dies, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Living in the murky waters of swamp-covered planets such as Dagobah and Nal Hutta, the dragonsnakes were large serpentlike beasts with sharp fangs. Although voracious, they were incapable of digesting metal. They hid under the muddy water, waiting for their next meal to come close enough. After snatching its prey, a dragonsnake would then dive back under the water.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Dragonsnakes were well armored with razor fins, and had rows of sharp fangs in their mouths. They used their wide tails to propel them through their watery habitat; their long arms were mostly used for digging or grasping. In mass, they could be up to 50,000 kilograms. The dragonsnake was a patient predator, usually lying in wait under the water until its prey wandered too close to the water's edge. Lashing out with fins and fangs, the dragonsnake would drag its victim underwater, coiled in its body, until it drowned.Only a few fellow Dagobah creatures posed a threat to dragonsnakes as their scales were durable enough to withstand most melee and vibroweapons and even small arms fire. Dragonsnakes were known to fight the monstrous swamp slugs of Dagobah. Even if devoured by the giant beasts, dragonsnakes could gnaw through the swamp slug's stomach and burst out of its belly. Dragonsnakes rarely mated more often than once every ten standard years, with females laying one to six eggs. These were buried and abandoned, usually resulting in consumption by predators. Hatchlings achieved full size within months and were adults.A breed of dragonsnake that resided on Nal Hutta differed greatly in its physiology, notably lacking arms and long external ears. Their body was covered in bioluminescent nodules, giving them a similar appearance to the Colo claw fish of Naboo.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> At some point during the pan-galactic conflict known as the Clone Wars, the Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos attempted to track down Ziro the Hutt on Nal Hutta. During the mission, Kenobi was attacked by a local dragonsnake. The creature was killed when the Jedi Master thrust his ignited lightsaber in the dragonsnake's head.In 3 ABY, the aspiring Jedi Luke Skywalker accidentally landed in the middle of watery peat bog on Dagobah. A hungry dragonsnake that hid there snatched Skywalker's astromech droid R2-D2, mistaking him for a living organism. Upon realizing that its prey was inedible, the dragonsnake forcefully spat out the droid, who survived the encounter unscathed.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>An Emperor's Hand, or Hand of the Emperor, is a Force-sensitive operative recruited, trained, and employed by Emperor Palpatine to perform missions that are impossible, secret, or both. <strong><em>Use.</strong></em> During his reign, Palpatine uses the Emperor's Hands to kill enemies where his more obvious tools, like Darth Vader or the Imperial Navy would be ineffective, too public, or inappropriate. Common targets include rogue governors, traitorous commanders, rebellious leaders, or other internal or external concerns.  The Hands are considered the best assassins of their day.<strong><em>Selection.</strong></em> Often targeted at infancy, potential Emperor's Hands are tracked with keen interest by Palpatine until they reach maturity and impress him. Some begin as thieves, some as warriors, some as assassins, some as entertainers, but each manages to demonstrate their resourcefulness, skills and loyalty without incurring his wrath.<strong><em>Training.</strong></em> After selection, an Emperor's Hand goes through comprehensive training in varied combat techniques, intelligence gathering and assassination. Each Hand operates independently and is often under the false impression that he or she is the only Emperor's Hand. During training, Palpatine cultivates the Hand's latent Force abilities, but avoids providing Jedi or Sith training. Thus, Hands who do not have any Force training prior to their training are not expressly dark side users. The most important of their abilities is a direct telepathic connection to Palpatine that allows them to communicate across the galaxy.<strong><em>Operations.</strong></em> Once given the title of Emperor's Hand, the agent is granted almost unlimited access and authority to accomplish their missions. Without naming themselves as physical manifestations of the Emperor's will, Emperor's Hands can take command of military units, starships or weapons as necessary. To preserve their effectiveness, only the highest echelons of the Imperial command structure are aware of the Hands' existence. The methodology varies by agent and mission, with styles ranging from silent sniper strikes to destructive rampages. Regardless of their method, each Hand operates as a ghost; striking and vanishing, which elevates them to near mythic levels amongst those who dare cross the Emperor.<strong><em>Psychology.</strong></em> Unaware, unconvinced, or unconcerned of the Emperor's malicious intentions, the Hands perform their missions out of sheer loyalty to Palpatine. They view their killing as a way of defending the citizens of the Empire from its most dangerous enemies, although in many cases their targets are political enemies, rather than rogue commanders or governors. Many, if not all, of the Hands are under the impression that they alone hold their particular position, and thus believed their relationship with the Emperor to be a special one. As a result of their extreme loyalty, and mental connection established through the Force, many Hands would be deeply affected by his death.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They live in complete darkness inside the mine's caves spinning webs made of glitterstim, a rare kind of spice. When fed ryll, the energy spiders produce glitteryll and grow to large sizes. A number of the creatures have been smuggled onto Ryloth, which is one of the few other worlds capable of supporting them.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> The spiders shoot webbing from their mouths to capture prey, impale them and then quickly suck the life energy from them. The spiders are known to feed on bogeys, as they are sources of pure energy that caused the glitterstim to react and produce light, alerting the spiders to their presence. The spiders also disliked bright light, since they lived in pitch black caves. Energy spiders were, however, drawn to the light produced by the glitterstim-bogey interaction, and there are even cases of mistaking other lighting sources for this interaction. They are one of the many threats faced by the spice miners, especially those who wander too deep into the caves where the spiders lived. Often, the administrators and superiors on Kessel will send disruptive prisoners to work in these deep tunnels, ensuring an often permanent solution to a prisoner problem. As energy spiders feed on energy, blaster bolts are ineffective against them and are merely absorbed. Curiously, ion weapons, since they affect energy and its distribution, are highly effective (but not lethal) against them.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

The average adult space slug grows to about 10 meters in length. Space slugs reproduce asexually by fission. Once an adult slug reaches a about 10 meters in length, a chemical trigger causes it to split apart into two identical but smaller slugs. Occasionally, this mechanism is overridden, and the slug grows to monstrous sizes that rival capital ships in sheer bulk, with some weighing over a million kilograms.<strong><em>Travel.</strong></em> A space slug travels through the asteroid fields they inhabit by pushing off the surface of one asteroid and floating through space to land on another. They also use stellar winds to help propel themselves through space. Through highly evolved sense of spatial awareness, they are capable of calculating the trajectory and distance of perilous moving bodies around them. This sense of spatial acuity also aids them in hunting food. <strong><em>Feeding.</strong></em> They feed on the minerals of asteroids, various stellar energy fields, mynocks (another silicon-based lifeform), ships, and other unfortunate creatures that unknowingly pass into its mouth. They are able to anchor themselves into a cave in an asteroid with tendrils, which also draws nutrition directly from the asteroid itself. Although their primary diet, similar to Mynocks, is passive radiation, they tend to chomp on rocks and metal as well. On occasion, a naturally occurring chemical trigger causes the space slug to kill whatever is near them. Colossal slugs are known to take sizable bites out of capital ships that pass too close to the slug's current dwelling, and even swallow smaller vessels whole. At these sizes, the mynocks they eat will often become internal parasites, rather than nourishment, living inside the cave-like esophagus of the slugs that ate them. Some slugs have entire ecosystems of other life living within their digestive tracts.<strong><em>Variations.</strong></em> Giant space slugs are larger than average ones. It remains unclear if they were a separate species from the common space slug, or just individuals larger than normally reported.Crimson slugs are native to the asteroids of Tapani sector and distinguished by a red stripe down either side of the body.Cularin space slugs are found in the Cularin system and are comparatively easy to train. Some theorize that they are descended from a domesticated form of space slug. Other theories hold that these exogorths are descended from natives to the world which formed the Cularin system asteroid belt (Oblis) before its destruction, and that these creatures survived and adapted to the void of space. They may have been related toâ€”or the same creature asâ€”the space worms which hollowed out the moon Eskaron.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>The exogorth, colloquially known as the space slug, is a gigantic species of toothed gastropod. <strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> They are silicon-based lifeforms that survive in the vacuum of space by making their homes in the caverns and craters of asteroids. The average adult space slug grows to about 10 meters in length. Space slugs reproduce asexually by fission. Once an adult slug reaches a about 10 meters in length, a chemical trigger causes it to split apart into two identical but smaller slugs. Occasionally, this mechanism is overridden, and the slug grows to monstrous sizes that rival capital ships in sheer bulk, with some weighing over a million kilograms.<strong><em>Travel.</strong></em> A space slug travels through the asteroid fields they inhabit by pushing off the surface of one asteroid and floating through space to land on another. They also use stellar winds to help propel themselves through space. Through highly evolved sense of spatial awareness, they are capable of calculating the trajectory and distance of perilous moving bodies around them. This sense of spatial acuity also aids them in hunting food. <strong><em>Feeding.</strong></em> They feed on the minerals of asteroids, various stellar energy fields, mynocks (another silicon-based lifeform), ships, and other unfortunate creatures that unknowingly pass into its mouth. They are able to anchor themselves into a cave in an asteroid with tendrils, which also draws nutrition directly from the asteroid itself. Although their primary diet, similar to Mynocks, is passive radiation, they tend to chomp on rocks and metal as well. On occasion, a naturally occurring chemical trigger causes the space slug to kill whatever is near them. Colossal slugs are known to take sizable bites out of capital ships that pass too close to the slug's current dwelling, and even swallow smaller vessels whole. At these sizes, the mynocks they eat will often become internal parasites, rather than nourishment, living inside the cave-like esophagus of the slugs that ate them. Some slugs have entire ecosystems of other life living within their digestive tracts.<strong><em>Variations.</strong></em> Giant space slugs are larger than average ones. It remains unclear if they were a separate species from the common space slug, or just individuals larger than normally reported.Crimson slugs are native to the asteroids of Tapani sector and distinguished by a red stripe down either side of the body.Cularin space slugs are found in the Cularin system and are comparatively easy to train. Some theorize that they are descended from a domesticated form of space slug. Other theories hold that these exogorths are descended from natives to the world which formed the Cularin system asteroid belt (Oblis) before its destruction, and that these creatures survived and adapted to the void of space. They may have been related toâ€”or the same creature asâ€”the space worms which hollowed out the moon Eskaron.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Their only known predators are sando aqua monsters breaching the surface of the swamp.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> Fambaas obtain food by knocking over trees to get at leaves and berries. They also forage for underwater plants, breathing underwater and swimming with ease. Fambaas reach sizes of up to 9 meters.Females lay large numbers of sticky, gelatinous eggs, which they deposit in puddles and underwater. The young hatch with moist skin and gills, and upon maturity, the gills disappear and their skin hardens.<strong><em>Herds.</strong></em> In the wild, fambaas travel in herds of up to twelve, but form breeding herds of hundreds of family units that are so large they are traditionally put to pasture in sacred swampy areas. There are also special fambaa stables contained inside the underwater hydrostatic bubble-enclosed cities for the domesticated breeds kept by Gungans. <strong><em>Domestication.</strong></em> The fambaa have been domesticated by Gungans for millennia as beasts of burden and cavalry/artillery draft beasts, sometimes carrying portable deflector shield generators or large booma cannons.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Their only known predators are sando aqua monsters breaching the surface of the swamp.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> Fambaas obtain food by knocking over trees to get at leaves and berries. They also forage for underwater plants, breathing underwater and swimming with ease. Fambaas reach sizes of up to 9 meters.Females lay large numbers of sticky, gelatinous eggs, which they deposit in puddles and underwater. The young hatch with moist skin and gills, and upon maturity, the gills disappear and their skin hardens.<strong><em>Herds.</strong></em> In the wild, fambaas travel in herds of up to twelve, but form breeding herds of hundreds of family units that are so large they are traditionally put to pasture in sacred swampy areas. There are also special fambaa stables contained inside the underwater hydrostatic bubble-enclosed cities for the domesticated breeds kept by Gungans. <strong><em>Domestication.</strong></em> The fambaa have been domesticated by Gungans for millennia as beasts of burden and cavalry/artillery draft beasts, sometimes carrying portable deflector shield generators or large booma cannons.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Fathiers are a species of non-sentient quadrupeds that are often used as mounts. Wealthy inhabitants of Kergans and Cantonica ride them in competition.</p>"

The skullborers drop down from trees and latch onto their prey to initiate feeding. <strong><em>Appearance.</strong></em> The skullborers are small and light in weight. The creatures have six spindly limbs, each ending in clawed fingers, that radiate from a central body having a neck holding a large skull, ringed with eight eyes evenly spaced across it. The skull has a large snout with an outer layer of skin and an inner, translucent feeding tube. Between the two layers of the snout is a ring of bone covered by a layer of crystalline teeth with a hardness similar to diamond. The teeth ring is connected to a muscular system at the junction of the snout and skull that allows the teeth to rotate, allowing the skullborers to cut through a variety of tough substances to feed, including heavy armor and polycarbonate. The skullborers have rigid and sharp spines on their back in four rows of four that contain toxins to poison those who touch the spines. Despite having light-weight, thin bones, the skullborers' skeleton is very strong.<strong><em>Camouflage.</strong></em> They species also possesses an active, full-body camouflage that hides them from the naked eye. However, if a skullborer falls unconscious or dies their camouflage dissipates, revealing skin that radiates color at the touch. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

Originally lower-caste members of the Rakata species, they were mutated and bred by the Infinite Empire by the thousands as soldiers. By the time of the Cold War, some Flesh Raiders survived on the planet Tython.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> The Flesh Raiders are extremely primitive and violent. Bulky bipedal humanoids, Flesh Raiders have razor-sharp teeth, which they used to strip the bones of both sentient and non-sentient prey. Eight small olfactory slits line their upper lip and two stumpy eye stalks protrude from the sides of their box-shaped heads.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> The origin of the Flesh Raiders is lost to history and they do not appear to keep records. From what little study of the creatures the Jedi Order was able to perform, the Flesh Raiders appear to have evolved from a more civilized society that devolved into their primitive and cannibalistic forms after the other colonists of Tython disappeared. Another theory is that the aforementioned society was attacked by the Sith and subjected to bizarre experiments which reduced them to maddened hostiles.<strong><em>Society & Culture.</strong></em> Having no established cities or formal government, the Flesh Raiders are tribal and erect temporary shelters on the Tythos Ridge. Flesh Raiders practice a form of spiritual worship: shamans have been seen inside their small settlements. Preferring naked earth, the Flesh Raiders scour the land they chose to occupy, burning away grass and trees and littering the earth with the bones of their prey. The raiders use signal fires to communicate over great distances.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>When the Force is strongly out of balance in a particular region, a Force Storm may form. Most Force Storms consisted of significant and violent weather patterns, while some were occasionally accompanied by volcanic or seismic activities. Force Storms could be caused by powerful presences in either the light or dark sides of the Force, the arrival of many Force-sensitives on the planet, or the death of many Force-sensitives all at once.  The eye of a force storm may be temporarily neutralized, greatly diminishing the effects of the storm for a short while.  However, only the resolution of the imbalance in the Force can truly stop a Force Storm once started.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the force storm can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:- Force Storm causes a blast of cold to burst from the clouds at a point it can see within 120 feet of it.  The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point.  Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 28 ([[/r 8d6]]) cold damage.- Force Storm casts the <em>force repulse</em> power.- Force Storm targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it.  The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute.  The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.#### Regional Effects- The eye is always at the center of a storm 6 miles in diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain of snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obsured.  Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. - Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 mile of the eye of the force storm. The heavy winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls, extinguish open flames, and disperse fog.- Howling wind and thunder claps fill the air within 1 mile of the eye.  Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving through or derive no benefit from the rest.If the Force Storm Eye is destroyed, these effects fade over [[/r 1d10]] hours.  These effects return, along with the eye, over [[/r 1d10]] days unless the conditions causing the imbalance in the Force are resolved.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Nexu are 4.5 meters long and generally 1 meter tall.The nexu has claws which can slice a Human in half. They have quills along their back, and a long tail that allows the nexu to swing from tree branch to tree branch. The tail also splits into two equal sections for a better grip on the tree branch they are swinging from. They have extremely sharp instincts and reflexes, although they are known to tire easily, and often use swift movements to finish an enemy quickly, biting down and thrashing their head about to break their victim's neck. Cubs are born pure white.The black nexu is particularly stealthy and rare.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Fyrnocks were silicon-based creatures found inhabiting Fort Anaxes, a military base used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Fyrnocks were hurt by sunlight and could only live under the cover of darkness, in which they became fierce predators. However, they were immune to lights that were not solar-based.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Gamorreans were a sentient species of green-skinned porcine humanoids that hailed from the Outer Rim planet of Gamorr.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> A species of tall, strong bipeds, the Gamorreans have porcine traits, like an upturned, large-nostriled cartilaginous snout, jowls, and upturned tusks. Their hulking bodies are covered in green, thick and hairless skin. They have five digits on every extremity, each sporting a hard nail. The digits of their hands include an opposable thumb, which allows the Gamorreans to easily grasp and handle objects. The species has two sexes: the males, referred to as boars, and the females, called sows.<strong><em>Society & Culture.</strong></em> Gamorreans have a clan-based society. Each clan is ruled by a female leader, the Clan Matron, and a male leader, the Warlord, although the Gamorrean society is, at heart, a matriarchy. Indeed, a Warlord holds his position by way of marriage to a Matron rather than force, although Matrons make their selections based on the boars' combat skills. Gamorreans see war as glorious, and violent clashes between clans are rife.Because of their low intelligence, Gamorreans tend to be both stubborn and loyal; philosophically, they believe that any problem can be solved by hitting it with brute force. They have a language of their own that sounds like mere grunts and squeals to outsiders. Although they can understand other languages, such as Galactic Basic, they find most of them too difficult to pronounce.Technologically speaking, the Gamorreans are primitive, and they favor melee weapons like vibro-axes and vibro-lances over blasters. They did not discover space travel on their own. Moreover, Gamorrean boars fail to maintain personal hygiene, rarely changing their clothes or wiping the streaming mucus from under their snouts.<strong><em>Across the Galaxy.</strong></em> Offworld Gamorreans are a common sight, be they mercenaries or enforcers working for crime lords.  They also colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system and are the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Geejaws are inquisitive reptavians native to Endor and known for their wide variety of calls and mimicry. They are small red birds with sharp beaks which they used to build nests. They lay several eggs at a time, with both parents caring for helpless chicks.Common prey of the temptors and other animals on Endor, geejaws have to build nests high above ground or in hard to reach places.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>A non-sentient, predatory, serpentine species native to the jungle swamps of the planet Rodia. <strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Ghests possess cartilaginous skeletons, a pair of bulbous, featureless eyes and a maw full of razor-sharp teeth. Their head is located at the end of a long, slender body, which is, on average, six meters in length. They possess slick skin, a tail, and four relatively thin limbs: two forelimbs and two larger hindlimbs, all ending in four thick, clawed digits. Where the forelimbs attach to the body beneath the head, the skin is particularly wrinkled.The species reproduces sexually, and females can even extract and use sperm from dead male members of the species. Once fertilized, a female lays hundreds of eggs which will hatch into juveniles, which appear as tiny versions of their parents. They are capable of extended hibernation.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Ghests hunt large species of herbivore and can walk on their hind limbs while on land, but hunt and mate while submerged in water. Ghests swim slowly when hunting, keeping all but their eyes and forehead submerged below the surface. It is not unknown for ghests to attack small Rodian settlements, devouring all residents within a few hours. Ghests have no natural predators on Rodia.<strong><em>Rodian Culture.</strong></em> Ghests hold an important place in Rodian myth and legend. Ancient Rodians believed that ghests, or swamp demons, captured the spirits of the dead; thus, sightings of the species were considered bad omens. Killing a ghest is sometimes believed to remove a curse, such as a drought or famine, so groups of male Rodians sometimes band together to ritually hunt down a ghest and kill it.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They have brown, warty skin and measure 1.5 meters in height. They are quadrupeds with dexterous forelimbs. A worrt's head features a pair of sensitive cranial palps; two bulbous eyes, yellow in hue; two nostrils; and a large mouth containing a long tongue and strong teeth laced with a venom potent enough to kill a bantha. Worrts lay large amounts of soft eggs, which are harvested for food and used as ingredients in drinks such as Jabba Juice.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Worrts feed mostly on insects and rodents. When hungry, a worrt settles into the sand, becoming indistinguishable from a rocky outcropping, and waits for prey to pass. When its victim comes close enough, the worrt throws its tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around the prey. The worrt's tongue then snaps back, throwing the food down its throat.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This form of droidspeak was referred to as \"Gonkian.\"<strong><em>Models.</strong></em> Notable power droid models included the EG-4 and EG-6 power droids produced by Veril Line Systems; the S9-series heavy power droid, a larger and more powerful version of the EG-6; the PLNK \"plunk\" power droid; and the popular GNK power droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton.</p>\n<p>While Gonk Droids are generally harmless, Groodo the Hutt, in his bid to destroy the Fondor Shipyards and Spaceport, employed, as part of his Droid Control Army, GNK Power Droids that were modified with rapid-repeating blasters in their upper casings.Likewise, the Alliance to Restore the Republic modified GNK units so they would march slowly across the battlefield, until they collided with an enemy building, and explode.</p>"

They sometimes attacked the villages of the Ewoks, who were among the sentient inhabitants of the moon.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Adult Gorax were usually over six meters tall. Some specimens were recorded that were up to 30 meters in height. A Gorax's ocher skin is covered in thick, matted dark fur, except on the face, hands and feet. Its head features two forward-facing eyes with bushy brows, a mouth full of sharp fangs, and slit nostrils. Its limbs terminate in four fingers, including an opposable thumb. All of these digits end in sharp nails. However, some variants are known to have three-fingered hands, and feet with two large toes. Their large ponted ears offered them a highly sensitive hearing.Gorax have immense strength; they are capable of uprooting a large tree effortlessly with both hands.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Gorax live in mountainous areas and rarely show themselves. Although they mostly behave like savage animals, they display a capacity to use objects as crude toolsâ€”for example, using an uprooted tree as a blunt weapon. Moreover, some wear crude pieces of clothing, like a sash made of furs and skulls, or a belted loincloth.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>The Greysor is a four legged, carnivorous primate from the planet of Naboo.

                    "value": "<p>Gundarks are a fearsome anthropoid from Vanqor known as one of the most vicious, strong, and aggressive species in the galaxy.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> These non-sentient creatures stand between 1 and 2.5 meters tall, with four powerful arms and large ears as wide as their head. Both their hands and feet end with opposable digits. Gundarks are covered in short brown or gray hair, but are birthed live with black coats of fur, and are able to fight almost as soon as they leave the womb. A gundark's hair lightens as it grows older and its large, bat-like ears began to enlarge until, at puberty, they reach the width of its head, hence the expression \"strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.\" These creatures are born with only two of its four adult arms, with the second pair emerging during adolescence.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Though not quite as intelligent as sentient creatures, gundarks are advanced enough to use simple tools such as rocks and clubs. (In spite of this, the expression \"gundark brain\" is used as an intelligence insult.) They live in organized family units inside hollowed-out trees or caves. Several gundark families often live together as a tribe, working for their common survival. Gundark society is matriarchal, with the oldest and most cunning female ruling the tribe. Males build the tribal homes and defended them ferociously from all intruders, attacking anything that enters the vicinity of the nest. Female gundarks are usually hunter-gatherers, acquiring the food needed by the tribe and training the young gundarks who aren't old enough to go out on their own.<strong><em>Gladiators.</strong></em> In gladiatorial arenas, a gundark is one of the most dangerous and feared opponents. Their short temper and thirst for blood means they will attack without provocation, even against opponents such as rancors or trompa.<strong><em>Variants.</strong></em> There are several subspecies of gundark, including the Burskan gundark of Burska and an unidentified green subspecies with four equal sized arms, a tail ending in a pincher-like pair of claws, two toed feet, and a more reptilian appearance. Another sub-species was the Brachian Beastlord which is found on the moon Lamus. It is particularly vicious compared to main-line gundarks, and has a poisonous bite.Some other species of carnivores are called gundarks, not because of physical resemblance but because of similarly vicious temperaments. These species include the long-necked gundark of Kharzet III and the aquatic gundark of Yavin 4.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Gundarks are a fearsome anthropoid from Vanqor known as one of the most vicious, strong, and aggressive species in the galaxy.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> These non-sentient creatures stand between 1 and 2.5 meters tall, with four powerful arms and large ears as wide as their head. Both their hands and feet end with opposable digits. Gundarks are covered in short brown or gray hair, but are birthed live with black coats of fur, and are able to fight almost as soon as they leave the womb. A gundark's hair lightens as it grows older and its large, bat-like ears began to enlarge until, at puberty, they reach the width of its head, hence the expression \"strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.\" These creatures are born with only two of its four adult arms, with the second pair emerging during adolescence.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Though not quite as intelligent as sentient creatures, gundarks are advanced enough to use simple tools such as rocks and clubs. (In spite of this, the expression \"gundark brain\" is used as an intelligence insult.) They live in organized family units inside hollowed-out trees or caves. Several gundark families often live together as a tribe, working for their common survival. Gundark society is matriarchal, with the oldest and most cunning female ruling the tribe. Males build the tribal homes and defended them ferociously from all intruders, attacking anything that enters the vicinity of the nest. Female gundarks are usually hunter-gatherers, acquiring the food needed by the tribe and training the young gundarks who aren't old enough to go out on their own.<strong><em>Gladiators.</strong></em> In gladiatorial arenas, a gundark is one of the most dangerous and feared opponents. Their short temper and thirst for blood means they will attack without provocation, even against opponents such as rancors or trompa.<strong><em>Variants.</strong></em> There are several subspecies of gundark, including the Burskan gundark of Burska and an unidentified green subspecies with four equal sized arms, a tail ending in a pincher-like pair of claws, two toed feet, and a more reptilian appearance. Another sub-species was the Brachian Beastlord which is found on the moon Lamus. It is particularly vicious compared to main-line gundarks, and has a poisonous bite.Some other species of carnivores are called gundarks, not because of physical resemblance but because of similarly vicious temperaments. These species include the long-necked gundark of Kharzet III and the aquatic gundark of Yavin 4.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Gundarks are a fearsome anthropoid from Vanqor known as one of the most vicious, strong, and aggressive species in the galaxy.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> These non-sentient creatures stand between 1 and 2.5 meters tall, with four powerful arms and large ears as wide as their head. Both their hands and feet end with opposable digits. Gundarks are covered in short brown or gray hair, but are birthed live with black coats of fur, and are able to fight almost as soon as they leave the womb. A gundark's hair lightens as it grows older and its large, bat-like ears began to enlarge until, at puberty, they reach the width of its head, hence the expression \"strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.\" These creatures are born with only two of its four adult arms, with the second pair emerging during adolescence.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Though not quite as intelligent as sentient creatures, gundarks are advanced enough to use simple tools such as rocks and clubs. (In spite of this, the expression \"gundark brain\" is used as an intelligence insult.) They live in organized family units inside hollowed-out trees or caves. Several gundark families often live together as a tribe, working for their common survival. Gundark society is matriarchal, with the oldest and most cunning female ruling the tribe. Males build the tribal homes and defended them ferociously from all intruders, attacking anything that enters the vicinity of the nest. Female gundarks are usually hunter-gatherers, acquiring the food needed by the tribe and training the young gundarks who aren't old enough to go out on their own.<strong><em>Gladiators.</strong></em> In gladiatorial arenas, a gundark is one of the most dangerous and feared opponents. Their short temper and thirst for blood means they will attack without provocation, even against opponents such as rancors or trompa.<strong><em>Variants.</strong></em> There are several subspecies of gundark, including the Burskan gundark of Burska and an unidentified green subspecies with four equal sized arms, a tail ending in a pincher-like pair of claws, two toed feet, and a more reptilian appearance. Another sub-species was the Brachian Beastlord which is found on the moon Lamus. It is particularly vicious compared to main-line gundarks, and has a poisonous bite.Some other species of carnivores are called gundarks, not because of physical resemblance but because of similarly vicious temperaments. These species include the long-necked gundark of Kharzet III and the aquatic gundark of Yavin 4.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Gundarks are a fearsome anthropoid from Vanqor known as one of the most vicious, strong, and aggressive species in the galaxy.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> These non-sentient creatures stand between 1 and 2.5 meters tall, with four powerful arms and large ears as wide as their head. Both their hands and feet end with opposable digits. Gundarks are covered in short brown or gray hair, but are birthed live with black coats of fur, and are able to fight almost as soon as they leave the womb. A gundark's hair lightens as it grows older and its large, bat-like ears began to enlarge until, at puberty, they reach the width of its head, hence the expression \"strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.\" These creatures are born with only two of its four adult arms, with the second pair emerging during adolescence.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Though not quite as intelligent as sentient creatures, gundarks are advanced enough to use simple tools such as rocks and clubs. (In spite of this, the expression \"gundark brain\" is used as an intelligence insult.) They live in organized family units inside hollowed-out trees or caves. Several gundark families often live together as a tribe, working for their common survival. Gundark society is matriarchal, with the oldest and most cunning female ruling the tribe. Males build the tribal homes and defended them ferociously from all intruders, attacking anything that enters the vicinity of the nest. Female gundarks are usually hunter-gatherers, acquiring the food needed by the tribe and training the young gundarks who aren't old enough to go out on their own.<strong><em>Gladiators.</strong></em> In gladiatorial arenas, a gundark is one of the most dangerous and feared opponents. Their short temper and thirst for blood means they will attack without provocation, even against opponents such as rancors or trompa.<strong><em>Variants.</strong></em> There are several subspecies of gundark, including the Burskan gundark of Burska and an unidentified green subspecies with four equal sized arms, a tail ending in a pincher-like pair of claws, two toed feet, and a more reptilian appearance. Another sub-species was the Brachian Beastlord which is found on the moon Lamus. It is particularly vicious compared to main-line gundarks, and has a poisonous bite.Some other species of carnivores are called gundarks, not because of physical resemblance but because of similarly vicious temperaments. These species include the long-necked gundark of Kharzet III and the aquatic gundark of Yavin 4.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They ere approximately two meters high, and their tough hide and carapace are able to withstand several blaster shots. They are also carnivorous and very aggressive.  They display little intelligence. They make a noise that sounds between a roar and a hiss.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> During the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems deployed gutkurrs to attack Galactic Republic clone troopers during the Battle of Ryloth. Gutkurrs were resistant to blaster bolts and were said to be the second-most dangerous predator on Ryloth, the first being lyleks. <strong><em>Distribution.</strong></em> Gutkurrs were found on the planet Ryloth and on the planet Onderon.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

These droids generally perform with unflinching loyalty to their masters, but rogue assassin droids are not unknown. Since their missions generally require a far higher degree of independent skill, savvy, and judgment than normally possessed by simple war droids, their programming subroutines, circuitry, and memory cores are of correspondingly higher sophistication.Equipped with an array of weapons, assassin droids are also used as elite infantry when the need for skillful and quickly adaptable soldiers with unquestionable loyalty arises.An inordinate number of assassin droids have achieved sentient independence, including IG-88 and C-3PX, presumably due to the higher level of autonomy incorporated into their processor design. These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>The HK series assassin droid, also known as the HK series protocol droid, is a combination of an assassin droid and protocol droid. The series designation stands for \"Hunter Killer,\" befitting their primary functions as assassins. They are manufactured by Czerka Corporation. Their ability to perform the functions of a protocol droid became a major reason for their unmatched lethality, as they could and would often act as normal (if quite sinister looking) protocol droids, thus concealing their true function and allowing them to get closer to intended targets. HK series assassin droids are equipped with an integrated emergency shield and jet pack.</p>"

The hooked beak of a hawk-bat contains tiny teeth that can tear prey to shreds, which they find with a combination of accurate eyesight and echolocation.Young hawk-bats hatch from eggs, lack feathers, have green skin, and are fully independent. Upon reaching maturity, the hawk-bat sheds its green skin for a purplish-gray skin.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Flocks of hawk-bats hunt and attack their prey as one. Though they favor granite slugs and shadowmoth larvae, hawk-bats will feed on anything that moves. Even large enemies can be taken down by a large flock of hawk-bats. If one hawk-bat is disturbed, all of its companions attack the aggravator at once. They usually travel in large flocks through the pipes and lower levels of Coruscant. Every few months, they migrate despite lack of seasons within the lower levels. Hawk-bats hate the cold and usually stay away from it. Many live on power cables or in heated vents, hanging upside down from warm pipes below buildings.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Though they favor granite slugs and shadowmoth larvae, hawk-bats will feed on anything that moves. Even large enemies can be taken down by a large flock of hawk-bats. If one hawk-bat is disturbed, all of its companions attack the aggravator at once. They usually travel in large flocks through the pipes and lower levels of Coruscant. Every few months, they migrate despite lack of seasons within the lower levels. Hawk-bats hate the cold and usually stay away from it. Many live on power cables or in heated vents, hanging upside down from warm pipes below buildings.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Known for their killing power and effectiveness, they are employed by many factions throughout galactic history. Autoturrets were used widely during the Jedi Civil War, with the Sith Empire deploying them to restrict access to the Undercity of Taris and to defend their military bases. Often, they were installed at the entrances to hidden bases, onboard capital ships, or near personal valuables.In the later stages of the Clone Wars, portable autoturrets were used by both the Grand Army of the Republiic and the Separatist Droid Army for covering fire or to reinforce the defense of field command posts. These autoturrets became the standard equipment of clone and droid snipers, who were entrusted with their deployment.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Hive rats were enormous, nearly hairless, rapacious rodents who inhabited the sewers and lowest levels of Coruscant. The mutant rat species was often believed to be the result of ecosystem damage and exposure to sewage, pollution, and reactor radiation.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>The hrumphs were powerful, thick-necked herbivores native to the Gungan swamps of the Mid Rim planet Naboo.Hrumphs received their name from the loud, deep, guttural sounds they produced. They had four long horns for defense and for the protection of their two long, sensitive ears.</p>"

In addition to those three meters, they have a meter long tail, covered in rows of spikes which stretch up past their backs and onto their necks. When in the lakes on Ambria, they hunt in pairs, grasping their prey with their strong jaws and sinking dozens of teeth into the unfortunate animal's body, while the other Hssiss sinks its jagged claws into it.<strong><em>Abilities.</strong></em> Hssiss have a potent, venomous bite filled or powered by the Dark Side. Hssiss also have the ability to conceal themselves and become invisible, possibly doing so through the Force. <strong><em>Origins.</strong></em> Hssiss originated as savage reptilian predators on Ambria, and were one of the few creatures to survive the planet's destruction. They lived in and near Lake Natth, where Jedi Master Thon had imprisoned the dark side energies that had plagued the planet for millennia. The dark spirits then began to possess the creatures, turning them into something much foulerâ€”it is said that these \"dark side dragons\" aided those who used the dark side of the Force. Eventually, Great Bogga began to use them as body guards and pitted them against those who had failed him. When he realized how effective and vicious they were, he had them transported off-world and sold in bulk. Soon, Hssiss could be found all over the galaxy, especially on worlds where the dark side was strong, including Korriban, Mimban and Vjun.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Hutts are a large slug-like sentient species native to the planet Nal Hutta. They are well known as galactic gangsters whose Grand Hutt Council controlls the Hutt Clan crime syndicate. <strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Hutts have large mouths, stubby arms, and three lungs. They are tough and muscular with thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine. Despite their legendary adult size, Hutts start out as tiny Huttlets less than half a meter in height.Their homeworld of Nal Hutta has a hot atmosphere and is frequently streaked by greasy rains, creating a fetid sauna in which Hutts are most comfortable. Hutts can live for centuriesâ€”Jabba was 604 when he was killedâ€”and can grow to enormous sizes.Some Hutts suffer from a genetic defect that causes their skin to be bereft of pigment and prone to cracking.<strong><em>Culture.</strong></em> Most Hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting in Hutt Space. They are typically obese, with the muscular Nar Shaddaa kingpin Grakkus being an exception.The Hutt Clan is divided into families known as kajidics: Jabba's family was the Desilijic kajidic. Hutts bandage and bury their dead. Classical architectural Hutt style can be seen on the planet Mataou. It is characterized by terraced buildings with sloping gates, and white and red colors.Clothing is optional for Hutts, and some use live Sha'rellian toops as hairpieces. Hutts like to eat gorgs, slime pods and Klatooine paddy frogs, and are known to smoke hookah pipes.Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu was a Hutt who ascended to godhood. To celebrate the deity's ascension, the celebration of Boonta Eve was created. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Hutts are a large slug-like sentient species native to the planet Nal Hutta. They are well known as galactic gangsters whose Grand Hutt Council controlls the Hutt Clan crime syndicate. <strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> Hutts have large mouths, stubby arms, and three lungs. They are tough and muscular with thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine. Despite their legendary adult size, Hutts start out as tiny Huttlets less than half a meter in height.Their homeworld of Nal Hutta has a hot atmosphere and is frequently streaked by greasy rains, creating a fetid sauna in which Hutts are most comfortable. Hutts can live for centuriesâ€”Jabba was 604 when he was killedâ€”and can grow to enormous sizes.Some Hutts suffer from a genetic defect that causes their skin to be bereft of pigment and prone to cracking.<strong><em>Culture.</strong></em> Most Hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting in Hutt Space. They are typically obese, with the muscular Nar Shaddaa kingpin Grakkus being an exception.The Hutt Clan is divided into families known as kajidics: Jabba's family was the Desilijic kajidic. Hutts bandage and bury their dead. Classical architectural Hutt style can be seen on the planet Mataou. It is characterized by terraced buildings with sloping gates, and white and red colors.Clothing is optional for Hutts, and some use live Sha'rellian toops as hairpieces. Hutts like to eat gorgs, slime pods and Klatooine paddy frogs, and are known to smoke hookah pipes.Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu was a Hutt who ascended to godhood. To celebrate the deity's ascension, the celebration of Boonta Eve was created. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

Several of these fighters are capable of ground-based locomotion and combat.</p>\n<p>The Hyena-class bomber, also known simply as the Hyena droid bomber, Hyena Droid or Hyena bomber, was a droid bomber used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems as a heavy ordnance craft during the Clone Wars. The Hyena bomber also was used as a fighter, but only when needed.  The Hyena-class bomber is similar in design to the Vulture-class fighter, but has a broader fuselage and two \"head\" units. Unlike the Vulture Droid, the Hyena bomber's wings separate in the middle while in \"walker\" mode. The Hyena-class bomber is capable of carrying four proton bombs, six proton torpedoes and six concussion missiles inside the bomb bay beneath the hull.

The body of ID9 seekers consistsd in a half-hemisphere dome with a red photoreceptor. Attached to that dome are five articulated, tentacle-like limbs that end in pincers. The ID9s are outfitted with electro-shock prods that allow them to harm organic lifeforms and incapacitate mechanical beings.

Since their missions generally require a far higher degree of independent skill, savvy, and judgment than normally possessed by simple war droids, their programming subroutines, circuitry, and memory cores are of correspondingly higher sophistication.Equipped with an array of weapons, assassin droids are also used as elite infantry when the need for skillful and quickly adaptable soldiers with unquestionable loyalty arises.An inordinate number of assassin droids have achieved sentient independence, including IG-88 and C-3PX, presumably due to the higher level of autonomy incorporated into their processor design. These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>The IG series is a series of droids manufactured by Holowan Laboratories.

                    "value": "<p>Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>After the InterGalactic Banking Clan secured Grievous's services as an enforcer, they refused to hire his Kaleesh, and thus the cyborg general demanded a cadre of \"more intelligent battle droids\" to serve him. The construction of the MagnaGuards was then commissioned for Grievous's service. Constructed by Holowan Mechanicals, MagnaGuards were roughly two meters tall, with a humanoid body shape, but possessed a far-superior mechanical anatomy. This allowed for superhuman acrobatics, speed, and combat ability. Their internal systems were furnished with advanced combat learning programs, which, compared to most of the droids utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, allowed the MagnaGuards to adapt to a highly diverse variety of tasks. These tasks ranged from melee and ranged combat to starfighter control. MagnaGuards were also capable of speech and were programmed to taunt their opponents in a low growling Basic.The MagnaGuard's weapon of choice was the lightsaber-resistant electrostaff, and wore cloaks and head wraps similar to the garments of Grievous's old Izvoshra elite during the general's time as a Kaleesh warlord.Grievous personally trained his bodyguards in the seven classic styles of lightsaber combat so that they could effectively engage and then kill Jedi. Grievous would not allow any repairs to be made to the droids, believing that their numerous scrapes and battle scars made them more intimidating to enemies. </p>"

Their light armor plating, brown and silver in color, made them fast at the cost of making them vulnerable to infantry attacks. Their red photoreceptor \"eye\" could lock on to both land and air targets at impressive distances, greatly improving the range of their missiles.Hailfire droids are equipped with two racks of missile launcher pods on either side of their heads, each carrying 15 guided missile warheads that leave behind a trail of black exhaust when fired. These projectiles are especially effective against stationary or slow-moving targets on terrain where blaster weapons are unusable due to a lack of clear lines of sight. The missiles are most effective at ranges less than a kilometer and follow deliberately swerving, evasive trajectories.  When the missiles are depleted, a hailfire droid is forced to rely upon its twin chin-mounted blasters.</p>"

It was larger than its sister agency Imperial Intelligence, and was led by ISB highcommand.The Imperial Security Bureau was formed by Galactic Emperor Palpatine as a secret police organization, dedicated to rooting out enemies of the New Order and maintaining stability throughout Imperial territories shortly after the proclamation of the New Order. Prospective ISB personnel were drawn from the Imperial Academy system and given training within the ISB Academy and Offices complex, located within the Verity District on Coruscant. Members went through a training regimen which included learning xenophobic propaganda, and were taught from the ISB Loyalty Manual. Members of the ISB were taught a specialized vocabulary to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term \"auditing\" was used to signal that suspects knew they were being investigated. The practice of provoking a suspect to commit a crime was referred to as \"crustbusting,\" and interrogating a supposed innocent in hopes he or she would react suspiciously was known as \"scattering.\" Framing a wanted suspect for a crime to makesure he or she would be arrested was referred to as \"Jabba.\"  Following completion of the Academy, recruits filed into one of several branches of the organization described below.High-ranking ISB agents could command stormtrooper squads, override orders of civilian and military authorities, replace questionable officers and commandeer Imperial military hardware, including Star Destroyers.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

It was larger than its sister agency Imperial Intelligence, and was led by ISB highcommand.The Imperial Security Bureau was formed by Galactic Emperor Palpatine as a secret police organization, dedicated to rooting out enemies of the New Order and maintaining stability throughout Imperial territories shortly after the proclamation of the New Order. Prospective ISB personnel were drawn from the Imperial Academy system and given training within the ISB Academy and Offices complex, located within the Verity District on Coruscant. Members went through a training regimen which included learning xenophobic propaganda, and were taught from the ISB Loyalty Manual. Members of the ISB were taught a specialized vocabulary to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term \"auditing\" was used to signal that suspects knew they were being investigated. The practice of provoking a suspect to commit a crime was referred to as \"crustbusting,\" and interrogating a supposed innocent in hopes he or she would react suspiciously was known as \"scattering.\" Framing a wanted suspect for a crime to makesure he or she would be arrested was referred to as \"Jabba.\"  Following completion of the Academy, recruits filed into one of several branches of the organization described below.High-ranking ISB agents could command stormtrooper squads, override orders of civilian and military authorities, replace questionable officers and commandeer Imperial military hardware, including Star Destroyers.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

It was larger than its sister agency Imperial Intelligence, and was led by ISB highcommand.The Imperial Security Bureau was formed by Galactic Emperor Palpatine as a secret police organization, dedicated to rooting out enemies of the New Order and maintaining stability throughout Imperial territories shortly after the proclamation of the New Order. Prospective ISB personnel were drawn from the Imperial Academy system and given training within the ISB Academy and Offices complex, located within the Verity District on Coruscant. Members went through a training regimen which included learning xenophobic propaganda, and were taught from the ISB Loyalty Manual. Members of the ISB were taught a specialized vocabulary to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term \"auditing\" was used to signal that suspects knew they were being investigated. The practice of provoking a suspect to commit a crime was referred to as \"crustbusting,\" and interrogating a supposed innocent in hopes he or she would react suspiciously was known as \"scattering.\" Framing a wanted suspect for a crime to makesure he or she would be arrested was referred to as \"Jabba.\"  Following completion of the Academy, recruits filed into one of several branches of the organization described below.High-ranking ISB agents could command stormtrooper squads, override orders of civilian and military authorities, replace questionable officers and commandeer Imperial military hardware, including Star Destroyers.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

These droids generally perform with unflinching loyalty to their masters, but rogue assassin droids are not unknown. Since their missions generally require a far higher degree of independent skill, savvy, and judgment than normally possessed by simple war droids, their programming subroutines, circuitry, and memory cores are of correspondingly higher sophistication.Equipped with an array of weapons, assassin droids are also used as elite infantry when the need for skillful and quickly adaptable soldiers with unquestionable loyalty arises.An inordinate number of assassin droids have achieved sentient independence, including IG-88 and C-3PX, presumably due to the higher level of autonomy incorporated into their processor design. These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>The IG series is a series of droids manufactured by Holowan Laboratories.

The Shadow Guards command a great level of respect within the Empire's ranks and often lead quartets of Imperial Stormtroopers into battle against the Emperor's most hated foes.

Members of the Inquisitorius were known as Imperial Inquisitors, Inquisitors, Red Blades, Mystics by Imperial officers, and sometimes even Jedi hunters. They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The Inquisitors were all former Jedi that had turned to the dark side in someway or another, with the Grand Inquisitor having served as a Jedi Temple Guard and the Tenth Brother being the former Jedi Master Prosset Dibs. The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as \"mystics.\" When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes.</p>"

Members of the Inquisitorius were known as Imperial Inquisitors, Inquisitors, Red Blades, Mystics by Imperial officers, and sometimes even Jedi hunters. They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The Inquisitors were all former Jedi that had turned to the dark side in someway or another, with the Grand Inquisitor having served as a Jedi Temple Guard and the Tenth Brother being the former Jedi Master Prosset Dibs. The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as \"mystics.\" When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes.</p>"

Members of the Inquisitorius were known as Imperial Inquisitors, Inquisitors, Red Blades, Mystics by Imperial officers, and sometimes even Jedi hunters. They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The Inquisitors were all former Jedi that had turned to the dark side in someway or another, with the Grand Inquisitor having served as a Jedi Temple Guard and the Tenth Brother being the former Jedi Master Prosset Dibs. The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as \"mystics.\" When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes.</p>"

During the Clone Wars, the term commonly referred to the security battle droid used by the Trade Federation and Confederacy of Independent Systems. The KX-series is one such example of a security droid model used by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>The JK-13 security droid, unofficially known as the \"Jedi Killer,\" is a JK-series security droid manufactured on the planet Ord Cestus. <strong><em>Appearance & Weaponry.</strong></em> The JK-13 is approximately chest-high and is divided into sections, giving it an insect-like appearance in its attack mode-so much so that the cave spiders, who used to rule Cestus, thought of them a natural enemy Its primary weapon is a set of stun tentacles extending from virtually every point on its body: these tentacles can be used to cut an opponent or deliver a disabling charge. Its primary defense is a deflector shield generator-like technology that allows it to absorb weapons fire before it even comes into contact with the droid itself.Like all Cestus Cybernetics droids of its period, the JK-13 is unusually ornate and flexible, with a golden finish and enormous articulation of its tentacles, which can become a fine strand or thicker rope or cable as needed.<strong><em>Bio Droid.</strong></em> The JK-13s are bio-droids: they use a living circuit design incorporating organics into the core processor, which is actually a life-support unit for a creature known as a dashta eel. Because the eels are Force-sensitive, they grant the droid some measure of precognitive abilities. This, in turn, grant it great combat ability.  However, Dashta eels cannot kill another sentient being without going insane, meaning that the droids can never be deployed as general purpose combat units.<strong><em>Availability.</strong></em> They sell faster than they can be produced, and cost 80,000 credits. They are assembled by Clandes Industrial in the city of Clandes.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>These herbivores would get food and water from plants and shrubs relying on a small nipping beak and a wide, 180-degree vision range for protection from predators like anooba. They had long ears which they used for hearing, heat dissipation, and communication. These ears relayed the creatures' attitude. When alarmed, they would put both ears up; when curious, they would put one ear up and leave the other down; when all was well, they would simply leave both ears down.</p>"

They had a reputation for swindling and for selling hastily refurbished equipment and faulty droids.Each clan family had distinct territories for living and scavenging. Each clan was led by a Clan-Chief, who was male. However the overall operation of the Jawa clan was overseen by a female Shaman.

They had a reputation for swindling and for selling hastily refurbished equipment and faulty droids.Each clan family had distinct territories for living and scavenging.

They had a reputation for swindling and for selling hastily refurbished equipment and faulty droids.Each clan family had distinct territories for living and scavenging. Each clan was led by a Clan-Chief, who was male. However the overall operation of the Jawa clan was overseen by a female Shaman. A female Jawa became a shaman by either possessing some kind of Force ability with which to perform magic, overcoming an illness accompanied by a hallucinatory vision or was chosen and trained as the successor to the current Shaman.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Ysalamiri are furry, lizard-like tree-dwellers about 2 feet in length, native to the planet Myrkr, and most known for their ability to create a Force-neutral bubble. This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Jubba birds are found on the planet Dagobah. They have purple and brown colored skin, with a yellow beak, two wings, a lengthy tail and a pair of spindly legs. Known for their soothing songs, they live in the planet's swamplands, where they use mud scooped from Dragonsnake Bog to make heavy nests that weigh down the trees they are built in.</p>"

They moved on four legs tipped with three-clawed paws, and had long tails and ears. Typically not much bigger than two meters, they possessed big, sharp fangs used to seize prey, and had large, yellow eyes.Womp rats were not timid creatures, hunting in packs and using their fangs to seize prey. When alone, a single womp rat was known to devour the garbage left by moisture farmers. When traveling in packs of up to 20 individuals, Womp Rats were known to overwhelm larger prey items, such as Dewbacks and Banthas. When they bite, their teeth set in and the animals will not release their hold, even if they are killed. There were three species of womp rats: ones that lived in Beggar's Canyon, ones that lived in the Jundland Wastes, and swamp womp rats. The Jundland Wastes womp rat appeared shortly after Imperials arrived on Tatooine, and some have speculated it was a mutated form of the Beggar's Canyon womp rat, affected by chemicals from Imperial waste dumps. Some of its mutations include a larger size, slower reproduction rate, and lower numbers than Beggar's Canyon womp rat. Their ears are also elongated and winglike. Another variety, the swamp womp rat, was found on a few fringe worlds as well as on Cularin.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Because they mainly sell their wares to moisture farmers and small town businesses, Jawas know what peoples' needs are, and are able to create custom droids to meet the individual needs of any customer.  Some junk droids are even made by themselves.  Because of their often mashed-together programming, they are considered dangerous by most civilized people, for they could go on a rampage, confuse orders, or even start building more of their own kind when having enough junk to do so.Though no two junk droids are exactly the same, they are generally constructed in four classes:<em> The Mechano-droid was a heavy labor unit</em> The Tracto-droid was a mobile scanning/radar unit<em> The Quad-pod droid was a cargo carrier</em> The Rollarc droid was a multipurpose unit suited to variable tasksJunk droids are sometimes sought after by eccentric collectors looking to find the most functional droid comprised the most incorporated parts that is the most pleasing to the eye.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Because they mainly sell their wares to moisture farmers and small town businesses, Jawas know what peoples' needs are, and are able to create custom droids to meet the individual needs of any customer.  Some junk droids are even made by themselves.  Because of their often mashed-together programming, they are considered dangerous by most civilized people, for they could go on a rampage, confuse orders, or even start building more of their own kind when having enough junk to do so.Though no two junk droids are exactly the same, they are generally constructed in four classes:<em> The Mechano-droid was a heavy labor unit</em> The Tracto-droid was a mobile scanning/radar unit<em> The Quad-pod droid was a cargo carrier</em> The Rollarc droid was a multipurpose unit suited to variable tasksJunk droids are sometimes sought after by eccentric collectors looking to find the most functional droid comprised the most incorporated parts that is the most pleasing to the eye.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

The mouth is a gaping circular maw filled with concentric rings of teeth.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> K'lor'slugs are carnivorous hunters on their homeworld, possessing keen olfactory and visual senses in addition to a deadly venom. For reproduction, the creatures lay more than 300 eggs in a single birthing period. When hatched, the young k'lor'slug is immediately ravenous for food. In addition to their aggressiveness, these creatures are considered pests aboard starships. They are known to invade the darkest spots on unsanitary space vehicles and breed. When dealing with more than 300 eggs hatching, an infestation aboard a space vehicle could become harder to controlâ€”and more potentially fatalâ€”the longer it is tolerated.<strong><em>Cultural Impact.</strong></em> Because of their notoriety as an aggressive and deadly species, they are used as a holomonster playing piece in the popular strategy game, dejarik.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

The droids were designed with exaggerated human proportions but with the mobility of a human athlete. They were able to operate a variety or tools and equipment and can carry gear without becoming exhausted.While the Imperial Senate had prohibited the creation of battle droids, Arakyd was able to use a loophole in the law by marketing the KX-series as \"security droids.\" They were programmed without the standard restriction against harming organic sentient lifeforms.The KX-series droids were programmed to speak and interact with people, but were not as proficient at it as protocol droids were. They could handle a wide range of tasks, including escorting dignitaries, protecting important people and defending Imperial installations.

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Kaadu, native to Naboo, travel in herds numbering in the millions. They are amphibious, being able to stay underwater for up to two hours. Kaadu build their nests in muddy swamps and grassy plains, where the females lay between 100 and 250 eggs at a time.</p>"

Their paws have opposable digits, and their lower limbs are covered with sharp spurs, both of which allow them to climb and hang from the branches of the giant wroshyr trees and feed on tree-burrowers.<strong><em>Wookiee Culture.</strong></em> Katarns are creatures of great importance in the Wookiees' culture. The Wookiees, who call the katarn the \"Old Prince\", hunt them in their hrrtayyk ceremony. Wookiees say the katarns were born by a wound to Kashyyyk that fell from the sky ages ago and made a home for the katarn. The katarns then hunted the Wookiees, thus unlocking the Wookiees' \"inner fire\". To thank the katarn, the Wookiees hunt them. They believe that someday it will be the katarn's turn to hunt the Wookiees again. Some katarns are domesticated as the war-mounts of Wookiee dragon troopers. <strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Katarns are ferocious and merciless predators thatd track their prey for long periods before choosing an opportune moment to strike.

Composed primarily of calcified wood, it would break free of its parent tree to roam the swamps and devour animals. After gathering enough nutrients, the spider would find a clear spot to anchor its legs, and if it survived that period, it would eventually transform into roots that allow the spider to grow into a towering tree. During this period it was vulnerable to bogwings and jubba birds.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Composed primarily of calcified wood, it would break free of its parent tree to roam the swamps and devour animals. After gathering enough nutrients, the spider would find a clear spot to anchor its legs, and if it survived that period, it would eventually transform into roots that allow the spider to grow into a towering tree. During this period it was vulnerable to bogwings and jubba birds.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra.

The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra.

The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra.

The organization of the kolkpravis was naturally tribal, as well as the names. The beginning rank of the kolkpravis was a warrior, who made up a kamen. Kamen was lead by a blackarm. Roughly 100 kamen made up a horde, which was lead by a tarkhan. Around 100 to 200 hordes made up a brigade which was lead by baatars.From several brigades came a khanate' which was lead by one of the eight khans of the Izvoshra. The Supreme Commander of the kolkpravis was the khagan, a title held first by Qymaen jai Sheelal, the infamous Lord Grievous.</p>"

They are generally designed to look like the sentients they serve; for example, 3PO-series protocol droids are humanoid.They possess knowledge about various cultures and customs, both to advise those for whom they were working, and to ensure their own behavior is diplomatic and culturally sensitive.<strong><em>History.</strong></em> Protocol droids constructed around 4000 BBY (around the time of the Great Sith War and the Jedi Civil War) were frequently engineered with certain behavioral shifts set to occur whenever another design-generation was reached. A number of these droids underwent radical changes with each new generationâ€”for example, when a C7-model droid supplanted the C6 variety. Each numeric \"jump\" in sequence could have had wide-ranging changes in functionality and temperament during that historical period.<strong><em>Programming Units.</strong></em> Cybot Galactica, the most famous and successful manufacturer of protocol droids, outfit them with SyntheTech AA-1 VerboBrains to give their droids personalities with emotions and the ability to learn and grow very similar to organic beings. The 3PO unit possesses a TranLang III communications module that can reproduce over six million languages, as well as reproduce any sound it picks up. Linguistic modules are also used to improve their speech functions. Some models, such as the pricey E-3POs, also include the TechSpan I module, making it possible to interface with Imperial networks and undocumented technologies of Imperial subcontractors.</p>\n<p>The LOM-series protocol droid was manufactured by Industrial Automaton and were designed with insectile features to emulate the species they were created to serve: the sentient Gand. The LOM-series had a flaw that allowed the personality software of a droid to be corrupted. Many LOM-series droids became enforcers in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. The most notable, 4-LOM, became a bounty hunter, sometimes seen with the Gand, Zuckuss.Aside from the insectile face, the LOM protocol droid was very similar to the 3PO-seriesâ€”indeed, Industrial Automaton made crafty deals with companies such as SyntheTech, to use many components initially used by Cybot Galactica. Thus, the LOM-series possessed an AA-1 VerboBrain and a TranLang III communications module programmed with millions of languages; it even had a similar body frame and plating design. Such blatant use of its trademark hardware caused Cybot Galactica to file a number of lawsuits against its rival company. Though their LOM units sold well in limited release, Industrial Automaton's future plans to monopolize the protocol droid market were dashed.</p>"

Maalraas have huge fangs that protrude from their round heads and are possibly the ancestors of nighthunters. <strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em>  Maalraas hunted in packs primarily preyed upon cannoks, although if there were too many of them the cannoks could drive the predator away or even kill it. Maalraas were in turn preyed upon by the zakkeg.<strong><em>Domestication.</strong></em> Easy to train from infancy or from older ages, Nighthunters are utilised as Loyal guard beasts and are exported from their unrecorded home world by crime syndicates as well as other wealthy individuals willing to trade on the black market. <strong><em>Spread.</strong></em> While plentiful at the time of the old republic era, by the time of the Clone Wars, they were thought to be extinct, but at least one still survived on Parein II 4. A population exists on the forest moon of Dxun in the Onderon system and possibly Onderon itself. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

Over the course of her life, she became the Mother: she kept the peace between the Father's warring Son and Daughter and became a loving part of the family. But she was still mortalâ€”she grew old while her ageless family lived onâ€”and she feared she would lose her precious family. In a desperate attempt to hold onto the life she so loved, she drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge. Her actions corrupted her, transforming the Mother into the twisted, immortal entity known as Abeloth.<strong><em>Loneliness.</strong></em> Abeloth is antagonized by loneliness; she feels an absolute need to be loved and adored. She has fed her cravings by instilling in Force-sensitives a desire to be with her, and in turn catered to their every need and assumed the role as their mother. This need stems from her original fear of losing her family. When her family abandoned her on their planetâ€”the very reason she committed her crimes in the first placeâ€”she was driven insane by loneliness and despair. She feeds on fear and destruction in an attempt to gain more power; her ultimate goal is to recreate her lost family. She may try to force players to drink from the Font of Power, attempting to make replacements for the Son and Daughter.<strong><em>Appearance.</strong></em> Abeloth has the ability to change her appearance at will. However, Abeloth's true form is that of a humanoid and barely-female being with deeply-sunken black eye sockets and tiny silver eyes reminiscent of tiny stars at the bottom of a deep well. She has a long cascade of straw-like, honey-blond hair that reaches to the ground and a large, full-lipped mouth that stretches from ear-to-ear and contains needle-like teeth. Her arms are stubby, protruding no more than ten centimeters from her shoulders, with hands that had long, writhing tentacles for fingers with suction cup tips. Her body is rigid and straight, and when she walks or runs, her legs ripple forward more than they swing. In addition, her body may be enshrouded in mist, giving her an ethereal aspect to her already frightening appearance.<strong><em>Powers & Abilities.</strong></em>  Abeloth's strength in the Force is a dozen times that of the most powerful Force user in the galaxy.  She wields exceptional telekinetic powers, being able to release waves of Force energy that cause beings in her vicinity to implode, those farther away to be ripped to pieces, and buildings to melt to the ground. She is also able to teleport herself from one place to another. Abeloth can produce a Force-flash, affecting the visuals of ships in an entire star system. Abeloth can command the native flora of her planet.  She has the ability to influence the minds of Force-sensitive beings who have spent an extended period of time in the Maw, causing a psychosis which makes them believe that everyoneâ€”except for other such psychotic beingsâ€”has been replaced by impostors and instilling in them a desire to find her. <strong><em>Possession.</strong></em> Abeloth is capable of possessing or absorbing the consciousness of beings in order to further enhance her power. Abeloth is able to take on the physical appearances of beings that she has consumed, and she is also able to project images of other beings.  She prefers to inhabit the bodies of Force-sensitives, as non Force-sensitives' bodies fail to last for long before deteriorating.  However, her dependency on avatars may ultimately be her greatest weakness: killing a significant number of avatars in her possession appears to result in her strength weakening such that her manifestation may be defeated. <strong><em>Imprisonment.</strong></em> For thousands of years, Abeloth has been imprisoned in the Maw, which is a cluster of black holes artificially created by Centerpoint Station and maintained from within by Sinkhole Station.  These stations are believed to have been created by the Celestials.  Abeloth's release from the Maw may be due to a number of reasons including the destruction or compromise of Sinkhole Station, or by a Current of the Force being altered and the flow of time changing. <strong><em>Defeat.</strong></em> If enough of her avatars are defeated, Abeloth's primary manifestation, usually in and about her home planet in the Maw, may be defeated in combat.  Such a Force entity cannot be \"truly\" killed by normal means. It is thought that, if defeated, Abeloth would return: perhaps in one hundred years or perhaps in one hundred thousand years. However, it is believed by some that the Dagger of Mortis would be capable of killing Abeloth permanently. Additionally or alternatively, Abeloth may be contained by recreating the prison of the Maw or by some other equivalent means. </p>\n<p>Abeloth's home planet is located in the Maw.  Abeloth holds complete control over the planet's flora and fauna. The planet is notable for having numerous physical locations that corresponded to metaphysical locations in the realm known as beyond shadows. The planet was inhabited by the Ones until the Son and Daughter imprisoned Abeloth on the world.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Abeloth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:- Abeloth creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in any square within 1 mile of Abeloth.  On her turn, Abeloth can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to her walking speed (no action required).  The first time a creature interacts physically with the duplicate, the duplicate disappears.- Abeloth causes up to 2 beasts within the lair to become dominated.  They obey her telepathic commands, which reach the entire lair.- Up to four plant creatures within the lair can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack.#### Regional EffectsThe region around Abeloth's lair is warped by her will, creating the following effect:- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the Lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness: \"Everyoneâ€”except for other such psychotic beingsâ€”has been replaced by imposters.  I must find Abeloth.\" A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be effected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  This madness lasts until cured or until Abeloth is defeated.If Abeloth is defeated, these effects fade over the course of [[/r 1d10]] days.</p>"

Massiffs were domesticated for sentry and guard tasks, and were used by the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> A massiff is a squat quadruped with a row of spines along their humped backs. Native to desert environments, massiffs are snarling hunters with powerful and dangerous bites. The creature's spines afford it an extra level of defense, and its large eyes allow it to see well at night. An average massiff stood at roughly one meter high, and the species is found on a variety of worlds, typically in desert habitats such as Tatooine, Geonosis, and Florrum.It is easy to tell the age of a massiff, for they grow a new pair of antlers every standard year.<strong><em>Domestication.</strong></em> Many massiffs are domesticated and trained for sentry and guard duty. Tusken Raiders, Weequay pirates, and even clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic utilize massiffs as guard beasts. During the Clone Wars, ARF troopers trained massiffs as trackers. On occasion, massiffs were used in arena fighting.<strong><em>Geonosis.</strong></em> The Geonosians and massiffs have a somewhat symbiotic relationship; in exchange for shelter, the creatures rid the hives of pests.  On Geonosis, possession of a massiff is a sign of authority and aristocracy.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.<strong><em>Clone Wars.</strong></em> Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire.</p>\n<p>Melee destroyer droids are an early variation of the Trade Federation droideka. Developed as the ultimate melee unit, the Melee Destroyer Droid is tougher than the standard droidekas but utilizes weaker shields. The primary weapon of the grapple droideka is its lethal mechanical claws. </p>"

                    "value": "<p>The Mistryl Shadow Guards were an elite group of all-female Human mercenaries, sent from their home planet of Emberlene to earn money in support of the devastated communities of their world.<strong><em>Emberlene.</strong></em> Using its might and wealth to conquer its neighbors, Emberlene subjugated dozens of worlds in their sector, plundering their wealth, and destroyed anything of value couldn't be taken.<strong><em>The Destruction.</strong></em> The remaining planets in the sector pooled their resources and hired a mercenary army to fight for them. The mercenaries struck hard and fast, devastating Emberlene's forces and reducing the planet's infrastructure to rubble. Ensuing firestorms and air strikes against populated areas effectively ended the Emberlene threat, reducing its people to abject poverty.<strong><em>The Lie.</strong></em> In the years after their destruction and partial reconstruction, the Eleven Elders decided to create a lie from this disaster. From a young age, the citizens of Emberlene were taught that many years ago, while the Galactic Empire was still young and early resistance had not been crushed, Emperor Palpatine ordered the destruction of Emberlene as an example to all who thought they could escape the rule of the Empire. This lie was created to instill a sense of loyalty and pride in the people of Emberlene, as well as a false sense of duty amongst the Mistryl.<strong><em>Organization.</strong></em> The Shadow Guard typically operated in small teams led by a commander known as the Team Prime. On the other hand, Mistryl sometimes traveled as master-and-apprentice pairs, and individual warriors could be contracted out long-term as bodyguards. True to their mythos that Emberlene had been ravaged by Imperial forces, the Mistryl claimed that they never worked for the New Order, although when that loathing got in the way of a job, they often forgot this animosity, either through convenience or necessity.<strong><em>Equipment & Methods.</strong></em> While the Guard were deadly at any time, the Shadow Guard were especially adept at close-quarters combat. They were well trained in martial arts, and also had a large amount of weapons training as well. They were trained to use hold-out blasters and vibroblades, and were also educated in the use of more exotic weapons such as hand claws, shock whips, and zenji needles.The Mistryl were legendary for their stealth and ability to remain unnoticed at all times. They had access to a huge database of profiles of galactic citizens. When needed, a guard could quickly use one of these and assume that person's identity in order to either get close to a target or get away from an area.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

The mercenaries struck hard and fast, devastating Emberlene's forces and reducing the planet's infrastructure to rubble. Ensuing firestorms and air strikes against populated areas effectively ended the Emberlene threat, reducing its people to abject poverty.<strong><em>The Lie.</strong></em> In the years after their destruction and partial reconstruction, the Eleven Elders decided to create a lie from this disaster. From a young age, the citizens of Emberlene were taught that many years ago, while the Galactic Empire was still young and early resistance had not been crushed, Emperor Palpatine ordered the destruction of Emberlene as an example to all who thought they could escape the rule of the Empire. This lie was created to instill a sense of loyalty and pride in the people of Emberlene, as well as a false sense of duty amongst the Mistryl.<strong><em>Organization.</strong></em> The Shadow Guard typically operated in small teams led by a commander known as the Team Prime. On the other hand, Mistryl sometimes traveled as master-and-apprentice pairs, and individual warriors could be contracted out long-term as bodyguards. True to their mythos that Emberlene had been ravaged by Imperial forces, the Mistryl claimed that they never worked for the New Order, although when that loathing got in the way of a job, they often forgot this animosity, either through convenience or necessity.<strong><em>Equipment & Methods.</strong></em> While the Guard were deadly at any time, the Shadow Guard were especially adept at close-quarters combat. They were well trained in martial arts, and also had a large amount of weapons training as well. They were trained to use hold-out blasters and vibroblades, and were also educated in the use of more exotic weapons such as hand claws, shock whips, and zenji needles.The Mistryl were legendary for their stealth and ability to remain unnoticed at all times. They had access to a huge database of profiles of galactic citizens. When needed, a guard could quickly use one of these and assume that person's identity in order to either get close to a target or get away from an area.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>The Mistryl Shadow Guards were an elite group of all-female Human mercenaries, sent from their home planet of Emberlene to earn money in support of the devastated communities of their world.<strong><em>Emberlene.</strong></em> Using its might and wealth to conquer its neighbors, Emberlene subjugated dozens of worlds in their sector, plundering their wealth, and destroyed anything of value couldn't be taken.<strong><em>The Destruction.</strong></em> The remaining planets in the sector pooled their resources and hired a mercenary army to fight for them. The mercenaries struck hard and fast, devastating Emberlene's forces and reducing the planet's infrastructure to rubble. Ensuing firestorms and air strikes against populated areas effectively ended the Emberlene threat, reducing its people to abject poverty.<strong><em>The Lie.</strong></em> In the years after their destruction and partial reconstruction, the Eleven Elders decided to create a lie from this disaster. From a young age, the citizens of Emberlene were taught that many years ago, while the Galactic Empire was still young and early resistance had not been crushed, Emperor Palpatine ordered the destruction of Emberlene as an example to all who thought they could escape the rule of the Empire. This lie was created to instill a sense of loyalty and pride in the people of Emberlene, as well as a false sense of duty amongst the Mistryl.<strong><em>Organization.</strong></em> The Shadow Guard typically operated in small teams led by a commander known as the Team Prime. On the other hand, Mistryl sometimes traveled as master-and-apprentice pairs, and individual warriors could be contracted out long-term as bodyguards. True to their mythos that Emberlene had been ravaged by Imperial forces, the Mistryl claimed that they never worked for the New Order, although when that loathing got in the way of a job, they often forgot this animosity, either through convenience or necessity.<strong><em>Equipment & Methods.</strong></em> While the Guard were deadly at any time, the Shadow Guard were especially adept at close-quarters combat. They were well trained in martial arts, and also had a large amount of weapons training as well. They were trained to use hold-out blasters and vibroblades, and were also educated in the use of more exotic weapons such as hand claws, shock whips, and zenji needles.The Mistryl were legendary for their stealth and ability to remain unnoticed at all times. They had access to a huge database of profiles of galactic citizens. When needed, a guard could quickly use one of these and assume that person's identity in order to either get close to a target or get away from an area.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Wars, cruel empires, criminal syndicates, and the predation of terrible beasts can destroy whole towns and force their inhabitants to become beggars, vagabonds and brigands. All who endure such hardships are hardened by their losses, staring at the face of danger and saying, â€”no more!â€”, taking their protection into their own hands.<strong><em>Unity is Strength.</strong></em> Fear and resignation are the strength of beasts and tyrants, despair is the fuel of revolt. Despair makes you stand and fight until the last sentient. When abandoned by lords, Jedi and the Force, the common man turns toward his neighbor for mutual protection. If separately they are no match for a beast or a trained trooper, an entire village or town banding together and fueled by despair, faith or hatred can take down their foe. Theses masses can become a force to reckon with, embodying the proverb â€”unity is strengthâ€”. A crowd can potentially include several individuals of high power, which would be left standing or escape once the crowd disperses.<strong><em>Crowd Mind.</strong></em> Racist pogrom chasing wookiees down the streets, slaves fighting for their freedom and ousting a tyrant, or commoners taking to the streets to protest the emperor; all are good examples of a crowd. A crowd is moved by its own motivations and the individuals that form it can differ widely, but once the crowd mind takes them, they act in unison toward a single purpose. Reasoning with a crowd can prove difficult, as the behaviors of both the individual crowd members and the crowd is heavily influenced by the loss of responsibility of the individual and the impression of universality of behavior, increasing with the size of the crowd.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it. When a crowd drops to 0 hit points the crowd disperses into a number of humanoids based on how large the crowd had been. Alternatively, a large crowd such as a riot or an uprising could deescalate into a smaller crowd type when it drops to 0 hit points or has fewer than half of its hit points remaining.</p>\n<p>An uprising can encompass countless numbers and only an army or a group of incredibly powerful individuals could hope to stand against a crowd of that extent. An organization mustering such numbers has a planetwide, and perhaps galactic, influence, gathering members from many regions into a single location. A entire city or metropolis revolting could provide the numbers for an uprising, spreading over several districts and into the countryside.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it.

Mole serpents range from 30-50 feet long, with chitinous plating and short, hornlike projections. By alternately contorting and relaxing its muscles, the mole serpent can create an undulating motion, driving the projections into the surrounding ground and pushing the beast forward. In its native soil, it can travel at speeds of 15 feet per round. One known serpent is known to have made its way to the deserts of Tatooine, and in Tatooine's soft sand, it can move as fast as 30 feet per round. The mole serpent cannot burrow through rock. The movement, of a mole serpent does not create a passable tunnel, but the ground is decidedly softer behind it.The creatures are the natural predators of the Tirginni beasts.

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>A moof has hoofed feet, a thick hide, and secrets milk. There are individuals who milk moofs, which inspired the term \"moof-milker,\" an insult to a person's intelligence. After recovering the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo used the insult in reference to whoever added a compressor to the ship's hyperdrive; in this case, it was Unkar Plutt, the previous owner of the ship.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Motts were a species of non-sentient, horn-nosed herbivores found on the planet of Naboo. They fed off swamp vegetation.  Motts were a species of stubby-legged quadrupeds that measured 1.10 meters at the shoulder. They had skin, sharp claws, small horns on their snouts. They had a high reproduction rate, with 15 young per litter. They were herbivores that fed on swamp vegetation.  Despite being herbivores, some motts could display aggressive behavior. They used their horns for defense, mating disputes, and for rooting in the mud for foodMotts evolved on the planet of Naboo, in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy. Their flesh was consumed by sentients.</p>"

The impressive armament of the tank includes ion cannons and heavy repeating blasters, although this weapons package could be swapped out with alternative packages that included shock rifles or concussion missile launchers. The tank moves by way of its huge central tread, and it is augmented on either of its sides by forward-mounted outrigger wheels on a pontoon tread, which gives additional stability. Infantry soldiers are also able to ride on top of these tanks. The NR-N99 Persuader-class tank droid is able to move up to 40 mph, but this droid tank lacks the agility of walking droid tanks. It is also able to plow through battlefields and ram barricades. The droid is able to function through a variety of terrain, and the droid is also able to move on top of water. The NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer  is well-armored, possesses heat exchange panels and communications antennae, and the unit has armor-shielded photoreceptors. It was designed to be able to function with its computer brain, but the vehicle could also be controlled by a pilot droid.</p>"

Escaped narglatches are a threat on Coruscant.  The narglatch are considered to be sacred by the indigenous Talz, who use them as mounts and a source of food.<strong><em>Biology & Appearance.</strong></em> The narglatch male had additional fleshy spikes, while females were smoother. They both had non-retractable claws and a fan-like tail that acted as a rudder during high-speed chases and turns. The narglatch also had densely padded feet that made for silent footfalls.A pregnant narglatch always gave birth to twins, one of each gender. Since young narglatch could hunt immediately upon birth, mothers abandoned them. <strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Cubs hunted together until maturity, making themselves less vulnerable to such Naboo creatures, as saw-toothed granks, veermoks, and even more mature male narglatch. As they approached maturity, the cubs separated.A solitary hunter, narglatch silently stalked and quickly killed its prey, usually kaadu or jimvu. Narglatch generally avoided deep water, although they were capable swimmers should the need arise. One of the few creatures they actively avoided were zalaacas.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Nerfs were a species of furry, non-sentient animals raised for their milk, meat, and hide. They could be found on a variety of planets across the galaxy, from Alderaan to Lothal. Despite their usefulness, nerfs were often regarded as disgusting because of their strong body odor.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Nunas, also known as swamp turkeys are diminutive bipeds that live in the swamps of Naboo. These birds cannot fly and are known for their stupidity, but are also adaptable and easy to care for. Nunas have spread across the galaxy, prized for their meat and eggs. They are omnivores, feeding mostly on plants and, on rare occasions, fish. An average nuna can feed a family of four. Nunas are also used as a ball in nuna-ball. When nunas become angry or intimidated, they can inflate their body to a larger size.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>The opee sea killer, sometimes referred to as simply an opee, is a large meat-eating crustaceous sea creature of approximately 60 feet in length. A hybrid of crustacean and fish, the opee sea killer is indigenous to the watery planet core of Naboo. <strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> The opee is a predator often found clung to rocky outcroppings or hidden in caverns or under ledges awaiting its prey. When forced to move, the opee is perfectly adapted to swimâ€”in its own unusual wayâ€”sucking water into its mouth and jet propelling it from pores beneath armored plates at the rear of its body. This unique technique, coupled with three pairs of powerful legs and a pair of pectoral guidance fins, allows the opee to accelerate quickly underwater. Once in range of prey, the opee extends its massive adhesive tongue, successfully reeling in its prey to a vicious, gaping maw of multi-rowed teeth. The opee also uses the long, antennae-like stalks protruding from above its head as lures to draw prey towards its double rows of fangs. Their thick chitinous hide can deflect small arms laser fire, along with glancing shots from heavy fire.Opees are known to be mouth breeders, with the male opee carrying fertilized eggs inside its mouth for three monthsâ€”forcing the male to fast until the young are born. From birth, opees can sustain themselves instinctively (and gruesomely). It is not unknown for unhatched opee eggs to be swallowed by colo claw fish, creatures later killed in a grisly manner when the new-born young chew their way out of the colo's stomach. This can also occur if the colo swallows young opees alive.<strong><em>Across the Galaxy.</strong></em> By unknown means, opees were introduced to Aquilaris, and can be seen swimming by the tunnels in which podraces take place.One opee sea killer is housed inside the Royal Icqui Aquaria, a large, public aquarium that is situated on the planet Coruscant, and the sea killer is the largest living creature in the facility.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Porgs of both sexes are covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They are much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They can fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They can also run quite swiftly on the ground and are good at maneuvering into small spaces. The birds have stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils. Porgs favor cold environments.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Porgs of both sexes are covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. They are much lighter than they looked, thanks to a thick outer layer of waterproof feathers with a fluffy underlayer for warmth. They can fly short distances but not far enough to leave their native island. They can also run quite swiftly on the ground and are good at maneuvering into small spaces. The birds have stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils. Porgs favor cold environments.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>The SD-K4 assassin droid, also known as the assassin probe, is a model of assassin droid manufactured by the Techno Union.

Spider-like droids programmed for quiet killing, SD-K4s move quietly on eight razored legs. They are equipped with multiple red photoreceptors for scanning their surroundings. If cornered or destroyed, an SD-K4 can release dozens of smaller probe killers from pores on its head to finish any job the assassin probe started.

They were tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi who had survived Order 66 at the end of the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>Purge troopers were Imperial clones led by the Sith Lord Darth Vader and the Inquisitorius during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Trained as expendable death squads, they were activated after the Jedi Purge and subsequent termination of the cloning operation on Kamino, making them the last generation produced from the Jango Fett template. As with their precursors in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic, Purge Troopers were programmed to obey Order 66, making them hostile towards all Jedi.  Purge Troopers were organized into death squads, although some Purge Troopers were known to engage their enemies without any nearby support. Each member had a red tattoo on the right side of their faces and had no hair.Every member was equipped with black armor that included several red or silver designs, kamas, and black helmets similar to that of clone paratroopers, with some sections of red. At least three members were also equipped with red pauldrons and at least three other members had a black pauldron with red lining, which was worn on their right shoulder. Each member had the Imperial crest on both shoulder pads. They utilized DC-15 blaster rifles and electrostaffs in combat. The troopers made use of Zeta-class shuttles and Imperial submarines as transports to carry out their duties.</p>"

These compact droids used tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed compartments. Many starfighters relied on astromech copilots to control flight and power distribution systems. Sitting in an astromech socket exposed to space, the droid, in addition to its piloting duties, could calculate hyperspace jumps and perform simple repairs.Most astromechs were only able to communicate in writing, conveyed via another computer system, or through a special code of clicks, bleeps, and similar sounds, known as binary. However, certain other droids, such as C-3PO, could understand the binary code of astromechs, and often translated from binary to other languages.</p>\n<p>The R2 series is one of the most popular models of astromechs. Created by a company called Industrial Automaton, the R2 unit's excellent design, high quality marketing, and lucky timing made this the standard by which other astromech droids are measured.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Rakghouls are a living plagueâ€”the manifestation of a highly communicable disease capable of swiftly transforming its victims into twisted, degenerate monsters with predatory instincts. The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and â€”luckyâ€” enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Hideous and possessing an appetite for flesh, Rakghouls are non-sentient, and are most commonly simple and animalistic in behavior. These feral rakghouls, known also as \"lower rakghouls\", are slaves to their instincts and especially their hunger, often traveling in packs numbering between four and eight, and attacking anything that looks or smells like potential food. Though they hold to no form of heirarchy, certain rakghouls, known to some as \"rakghoul fiends\", exhibit a manner of influence over their \"lower\" rakghoul brethren. Hardy and vicious, these rakghouls are generally believed to somehow maintain bits of their former intelligence, and direct other rakghouls to trap and ambush prey; it is even rumored that these rakghouls can use weapons.<strong><em>Muur Talisman.</strong></em> Rakghouls are a product of the Sith alchemy performed by the ancient Sith Lord, Karness Muur. When he forged the talisman in which he would later invest his mind and will, Muur imbued the amulet with the power to almost instantaneously transform nearby sentients into rakghouls that he could command and control. When a being possesses the Muur Talisman, they are able to enslave the rakghouls to their will, and command them as an army with the potential for nearly infinite expansion. Under the talisman's effects, rakghouls become more demure, and are able to call upon the knowledge and skills they had possessed in their former lives. Unfortunately, though, their former personalities can not be restored, as all that remains in the rakghouls is an imprint of who they had once been.<strong><em>The Plague.</strong></em> The talisman's powers did not work on all: Force-users and certain non-Human species are immune to the talisman's effects. To rectify this, Muur engineered the \"rakghoul plague\", a virus-like disease which is spread from a rakghoul's bite or scratch. Individuals infected with this disease later transform into rakghouls themselves; incubation periods varied, though the infection's manifestation was generally a rapid and painful experience, becoming a rakghoul within a timeframe of six to forty-eight hours. The body becomes twisted, skin pigmentation drains and the victim attains a whitened corpse-like state. Victims also bleed from pores in the skin, and from orifices such as the eyes. In the years following the Mandalorian Wars, the Sith Empire born of Darths Revan and Malak possessed a curative serum that could save an individual infected with the plague, and the Jedi Cade Skywalker could cure an infected individual with his unique healing ability, but once a victim fully transformed into a rakghoul, the only means of salvation lay in death.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Rakghouls are a living plagueâ€”the manifestation of a highly communicable disease capable of swiftly transforming its victims into twisted, degenerate monsters with predatory instincts. The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and â€”luckyâ€” enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Hideous and possessing an appetite for flesh, Rakghouls are non-sentient, and are most commonly simple and animalistic in behavior. These feral rakghouls, known also as \"lower rakghouls\", are slaves to their instincts and especially their hunger, often traveling in packs numbering between four and eight, and attacking anything that looks or smells like potential food. Though they hold to no form of heirarchy, certain rakghouls, known to some as \"rakghoul fiends\", exhibit a manner of influence over their \"lower\" rakghoul brethren. Hardy and vicious, these rakghouls are generally believed to somehow maintain bits of their former intelligence, and direct other rakghouls to trap and ambush prey; it is even rumored that these rakghouls can use weapons.<strong><em>Muur Talisman.</strong></em> Rakghouls are a product of the Sith alchemy performed by the ancient Sith Lord, Karness Muur. When he forged the talisman in which he would later invest his mind and will, Muur imbued the amulet with the power to almost instantaneously transform nearby sentients into rakghouls that he could command and control. When a being possesses the Muur Talisman, they are able to enslave the rakghouls to their will, and command them as an army with the potential for nearly infinite expansion. Under the talisman's effects, rakghouls become more demure, and are able to call upon the knowledge and skills they had possessed in their former lives. Unfortunately, though, their former personalities can not be restored, as all that remains in the rakghouls is an imprint of who they had once been.<strong><em>The Plague.</strong></em> The talisman's powers did not work on all: Force-users and certain non-Human species are immune to the talisman's effects. To rectify this, Muur engineered the \"rakghoul plague\", a virus-like disease which is spread from a rakghoul's bite or scratch. Individuals infected with this disease later transform into rakghouls themselves; incubation periods varied, though the infection's manifestation was generally a rapid and painful experience, becoming a rakghoul within a timeframe of six to forty-eight hours. The body becomes twisted, skin pigmentation drains and the victim attains a whitened corpse-like state. Victims also bleed from pores in the skin, and from orifices such as the eyes. In the years following the Mandalorian Wars, the Sith Empire born of Darths Revan and Malak possessed a curative serum that could save an individual infected with the plague, and the Jedi Cade Skywalker could cure an infected individual with his unique healing ability, but once a victim fully transformed into a rakghoul, the only means of salvation lay in death.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Rathtars were large, carnivorous cephalopods that were native to the planet Twon Ketee. Regarded as one of the most dangerous beasts in the galaxy, rathtars were known for hunting in packs, and their subspecies, the dwarf rathtar were involved in an incident known as the Trillia Massacre.   <strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> Although the study of rathtars was rare due to the danger posed by the beasts, it was believed that they shared common ancestry with other tentacled species such as the sarlaccs, the blixii, and the vixus of Umbara. Rathtars reproduced by fission, leading to rapidly increasing numbers if the species' population was not controlled.<strong><em>Hunting.</strong></em> Rathtars appeared physiologically primitive, endowed with only rudimentary senses and possessing small brains. Despite the appearance of a mindless eating machine, rathtars proved effective at working together, and displayed affinity for pack hunting. Individual rathtars appeared to become smarter when in proximity to others of its species, and rathtar packs utilized howls, at a frequency beyond humanoid hearing, to communicate among one another. They also vocalized deafening roars when attacking and devouring prey, and let out horrifying shrieks of fury when in pain. If in danger from a rathtar, one's best hope was to hide, as the creatures were largely blind.<strong><em>Feeding.</strong></em> Lacking a true skeleton, a rathtar had an enormous, round, slug-like body covered in light-reactive sensing orbs. They possessed multiple long, tentacle-like appendages; their principle feeding tentacles whipped out to capture and devour prey, which typically consisted of anything they perceived as non-rathtar. The creatures were ravenous and persistent eaters, capable of consuming virtually anything that they could fit into their robust, radial mouths, which were funnel-shaped and lined with rows of razor sharp teeth. Their throat distended outward into a hollow tongue, useful for swallowing struggling prey. The bilious creatures typically tore their meals apart piece by piece.<strong><em>Movement.</strong></em> Capable of locomotion, rathtars curled their ambulatory tentacles inward to form a ball and roll themselves forward in a whirl of whipping tentacles. They moved deceptively fast for their size, and had adhesive pads on their pointed tentacle tipsâ€”known as a clubâ€”which helped them attach to surfaces. <strong><em>Tentacles and Tougness.</strong></em> Their tentacles had enormous strength, and were of a muscular hydrostat form. Their fleshy bodies were covered in a hard, rubbery exterior, giving the rathtars a heavy resistance to blaster bolts, small-arms fire, and even biting attacks.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Rathtars were large, carnivorous cephalopods that were native to the planet Twon Ketee. Regarded as one of the most dangerous beasts in the galaxy, rathtars were known for hunting in packs, and their subspecies, the dwarf rathtar were involved in an incident known as the Trillia Massacre.   <strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> Although the study of rathtars was rare due to the danger posed by the beasts, it was believed that they shared common ancestry with other tentacled species such as the sarlaccs, the blixii, and the vixus of Umbara. Rathtars reproduced by fission, leading to rapidly increasing numbers if the species' population was not controlled.<strong><em>Hunting.</strong></em> Rathtars appeared physiologically primitive, endowed with only rudimentary senses and possessing small brains. Despite the appearance of a mindless eating machine, rathtars proved effective at working together, and displayed affinity for pack hunting. Individual rathtars appeared to become smarter when in proximity to others of its species, and rathtar packs utilized howls, at a frequency beyond humanoid hearing, to communicate among one another. They also vocalized deafening roars when attacking and devouring prey, and let out horrifying shrieks of fury when in pain. If in danger from a rathtar, one's best hope was to hide, as the creatures were largely blind.<strong><em>Feeding.</strong></em> Lacking a true skeleton, a rathtar had an enormous, round, slug-like body covered in light-reactive sensing orbs. They possessed multiple long, tentacle-like appendages; their principle feeding tentacles whipped out to capture and devour prey, which typically consisted of anything they perceived as non-rathtar. The creatures were ravenous and persistent eaters, capable of consuming virtually anything that they could fit into their robust, radial mouths, which were funnel-shaped and lined with rows of razor sharp teeth. Their throat distended outward into a hollow tongue, useful for swallowing struggling prey. The bilious creatures typically tore their meals apart piece by piece.<strong><em>Movement.</strong></em> Capable of locomotion, rathtars curled their ambulatory tentacles inward to form a ball and roll themselves forward in a whirl of whipping tentacles. They moved deceptively fast for their size, and had adhesive pads on their pointed tentacle tipsâ€”known as a clubâ€”which helped them attach to surfaces. <strong><em>Tentacles and Tougness.</strong></em> Their tentacles had enormous strength, and were of a muscular hydrostat form. Their fleshy bodies were covered in a hard, rubbery exterior, giving the rathtars a heavy resistance to blaster bolts, small-arms fire, and even biting attacks.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Wars, cruel empires, criminal syndicates, and the predation of terrible beasts can destroy whole towns and force their inhabitants to become beggars, vagabonds and brigands. All who endure such hardships are hardened by their losses, staring at the face of danger and saying, â€”no more!â€”, taking their protection into their own hands.<strong><em>Unity is Strength.</strong></em> Fear and resignation are the strength of beasts and tyrants, despair is the fuel of revolt. Despair makes you stand and fight until the last sentient. When abandoned by lords, Jedi and the Force, the common man turns toward his neighbor for mutual protection. If separately they are no match for a beast or a trained trooper, an entire village or town banding together and fueled by despair, faith or hatred can take down their foe. Theses masses can become a force to reckon with, embodying the proverb â€”unity is strengthâ€”. A crowd can potentially include several individuals of high power, which would be left standing or escape once the crowd disperses.<strong><em>Crowd Mind.</strong></em> Racist pogrom chasing wookiees down the streets, slaves fighting for their freedom and ousting a tyrant, or commoners taking to the streets to protest the emperor; all are good examples of a crowd. A crowd is moved by its own motivations and the individuals that form it can differ widely, but once the crowd mind takes them, they act in unison toward a single purpose. Reasoning with a crowd can prove difficult, as the behaviors of both the individual crowd members and the crowd is heavily influenced by the loss of responsibility of the individual and the impression of universality of behavior, increasing with the size of the crowd.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it. When a crowd drops to 0 hit points the crowd disperses into a number of humanoids based on how large the crowd had been. Alternatively, a large crowd such as a riot or an uprising could deescalate into a smaller crowd type when it drops to 0 hit points or has fewer than half of its hit points remaining.</p>\n<p>An uprising can encompass countless numbers and only an army or a group of incredibly powerful individuals could hope to stand against a crowd of that extent. An organization mustering such numbers has a planetwide, and perhaps galactic, influence, gathering members from many regions into a single location. A entire city or metropolis revolting could provide the numbers for an uprising, spreading over several districts and into the countryside.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it.

                    "value": "<p>Ysalamiri are furry, lizard-like tree-dwellers about 2 feet in length, native to the planet Myrkr, and most known for their ability to create a Force-neutral bubble. This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Rock warts were orange/brown insect-like crustaceans found on many planets. Their bite delivered a neurotoxin to their victim, which was then used as an incubator for up to twenty eggs.</p>"

These droids generally perform with unflinching loyalty to their masters, but rogue assassin droids are not unknown. Since their missions generally require a far higher degree of independent skill, savvy, and judgment than normally possessed by simple war droids, their programming subroutines, circuitry, and memory cores are of correspondingly higher sophistication.Equipped with an array of weapons, assassin droids are also used as elite infantry when the need for skillful and quickly adaptable soldiers with unquestionable loyalty arises.An inordinate number of assassin droids have achieved sentient independence, including IG-88 and C-3PX, presumably due to the higher level of autonomy incorporated into their processor design. These droids typically fund their independent existences through the use of their innate abilities, often plying their trade as bounty hunters.</p>\n<p>The SD-K4 assassin droid, also known as the assassin probe, is a model of assassin droid manufactured by the Techno Union. Used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, it was also referred to as the Separatist assassin probe and Separatist assassin droid.The SD-K4 assassin droid is designed to assassinate targets with high efficiency. Spider-like droids programmed for quiet killing, SD-K4s move quietly on eight razored legs. They are equipped with multiple red photoreceptors for scanning their surroundings. If cornered or destroyed, an SD-K4 can release dozens of smaller probe killers from pores on its head to finish any job the assassin probe started. Probe killers, similar in appearance to their SD-K4 host but on a much smaller scale, lay dormant until the activated. </p>"

Sandos have heavily muscled bodies that look almost feline, with strong limbs ending in finned claws that propell them through the depths.Their huge   mouths allow them to swallow most other creatures of the Abyss in a single gulp. Using their razor-sharp teeth, they are also the only predators capable of biting through the hard shells of the opee sea killers.Being mammalian, females nursed their young for about a year. Females bore  only one pup per birth. Their life-spans typically  reach one hundred standard years.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> The sando aqua monsters were carnivores. In order to maintain their gigantic bodies, those voracious creatures needed to feed constantly, and they often devoured entire schools of fish.  There have even been reports of sando monsters surfacing in swamp lakes and attacking falumpaset and fambaa herds, and unsubstantiated reports of them sunning themselves on sandbars.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlpool until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlpool, the creature is pulled 5 feet deeper inside it, unless the creature is at the bottom. A restrained creature moves with the whirlpool and is submerged when the effect ends, unless the creature has some means to stay afloat. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlpool and is hurled [[/r 3d6*10]] feet away from it in a random direction. The whirlpool ends at the beginning of the monster's turn unless the monster used the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain the whirlpool.  The monster creates a whirlpool in the water at a point within 30 feet that it can see. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-deep cylinder centered on that point. On subsequent turns, the monster can use the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain and move the whirlpool up to 30 feet in any direction along the surface of the water. The whirlpool sucks up any medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>The sarlacc is a large, immobile, omnivorous invertebrate with long tentacles that rim its mouth. There is some debate among xenobiologists as to whether the creature is a plant or animal, though most find the creature far too dangerous to merit an extended study of the question.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> They reproduce by spores, known as \"sarlacci,\" that travel through space until they find another suitable planet to inhabit. After implanting itself into the ground, the sarlacci grow downward like a plant, forming a pit. The mouth and tentacles are the most visible parts of the sarlacc. The rest of the sarlacc's massive anatomical features are buried up to one hundred meters deep in the ground. This guarantees protection of the sarlacc's vital organs and makes it invulnerable to most forms of serious damage. The sarlacc's mouth is the only part of the body visible, usually. Most of its body is covered in rigid plates. It has eight appendages beneath the ground used for stability or for reburial if the sarlacc becomes partially exposed. The body of the sarlacc ends in three roots used for moisture absorption.These appendiges and roots are also used to sense the vibrations from nearby creatures. The sarlacc lacks eyes and ears, instead relying on the sensors in its roots to \"see\" its prey. <strong><em>Feeding.</strong></em> The teeth of the sarlacc surround its beak-like tongue and plant-like tentacles in tiers. Its teeth are also slightly slanted inward ensuring its prey remains trapped. Despite their size, the sarlacc does not need to eat much or often. While its lightning-fast tentacles are used to snatch up its prey, they are not its primary means of capturing a meal. The sarlacc discharges odors and scents that lure herbivores and scavengers close enough for it to use its tentacles. <strong><em>Digestion.</strong></em> After being swallowed by the tongue, the victim makes its way into the sarlacc's stomach to be digested, being kept alive and slowly digested for a millennium. A strong network of vessels inside the stomach punctures the victim's skin and muscles before injecting neurotoxins into them, preventing the victims from escaping and ensuring that they remain immersed in the acidic fluids in the stomach, and attached to the walls of the stomach. The vessels also provide victims with nutrients to keep them alive while they are digested in agony.A number of smaller, secondary stomachs are used to store victims for later consumption at times when the sarlacc needs larger amounts of nutrients, such as when it needs to grow, breed, or strengthen its tentacles and beak for catching stronger, larger prey. The secondary stomachs also function as a space to store victims when the main stomach runs out of room. The acidic fluids in the stomachs are composed of weak chemicals that take much longer to digest prey than acids in the stomach of other creatures.  The pain endured by its victims in this process was reputed to be unimaginable.  It is theorized that sarlaccs may be telepathic and may gain consciousness from the creatures they eat by assimilating their thoughts and memories during digestion.<strong><em>Notable Examples.</strong></em> One of the known specimens of the species resides in the Great Pit of Carkoon, beneath the sands of the Dune Sea on the remote planet of Tatooine. Most sarlacci preferred damp environments, but they could live nearly anywhere including the desert sands of Tatooine.The largest known sarlacc in galactic history resides on the planet Felucia within the Ancient Abyss. It possessed massive tendrils and teeth that spread out over an area of the Abyss that was kilometers across.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Scurriers are a species of small creatures native to Tatooine. The bipedal runners sport an elongated snout, horn-like appendages, and a pointed tail. They are present in the streets of cities like Mos Eisley and in the vicinity of more isolated settlements like the Lars moisture farm.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Shaaks are a species of non-sentient herbivores that graze on the grasslands of Naboo. Gentle and non-threatening, shaaks are slow movers. They have four legs, brown leathery skin, and their bodies are plump with blubber. Shaaks are unable to swim, due to their size, and so avoid the swamps of Naboo. If infected with the waterborne Blue Shadow Virus, shaaks will die instantly, while members of most other species have 48 hours to live before the virus becomes fatal.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Sibian hounds are a type of hound native to the planet Corellia. A fleet-footed, loud-barking, vicious species, they are often used for attack and hunting, but do not make good pets.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Vicious, medium-sized, hematophagous flying reptomammals, skettos dwelled in the caverns of Tatooine. Only emerging when light conditions were at their lowest, these four-winged beasts possessed excellent twilight vision to assist in the consumption of airborne insects. Skettos fell into the reptomammal class, being warm-blooded and giving live birth to a single offspring at a time.The most horrifying part of a sketto's life was its tendency to swarm with others of its kind to suck the blood of large, sleeping mammals. Their large, frightening teeth helped to puncture the toughest of hides, and legend had it that a sketto swarm could suck a sleeping dewback dry overnight. Despite being a reptomammal, they bled green blood.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>The Spotlight sloth, or Dagobah swamp sloth, is a large furry mammal covered in a waterproof greenish-brown fur. They are so named because of the blue bioluminescent patches beneath the leathery skin on their hairless chests. These \"spotlight\" patches, when revealed, are used to induce plants and fungi to unfold and/or burst. The sloth then uses its small paws to quickly stuff food in to its toothless mouth.The sloths are preyed upon by Dagobah's knobby white spiders. One stab of the spider's venomous stinger can knock out an unlucky sloth.</p>"

Starweirds have long, wild white hair that floats around their heads, ignoring gravity. The creatures have pale skin and their faces are desiccated. Many witnesses state that the creature's face somewhat resembles their own. Starweirds each have a large, toothy mouth and eyes that glow. Their arms are bony and end in hands with three large, sharp, black talons. The species' incorporeal nature makes it possible for the creatures to resist conventional attacks and pass through solid objects, although force fields still stop the creatures. They are also fully affected by the use of the Force. Starweirds hover or fly silently instead of walking. While fairly intelligent, the creatures do not communicate and had no known language. They have no known ecological role, and after dying, a starweird leaves no traces of itself.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Starweirds may appear to spacers repairing their damaged starship in deep space, or manifest aboard a ship traveling in hyperspace. Upon being spotted, starweirds become enraged and released a loud, piercing telepathic shriek. The creatures are noted for having a particular hatred for Force-sensitives, who they will mindlessly concentrate on killing even if there are other creatures present.Some Jedi hypothesize that they are physical manifestations of the dark side of the Force. However, there is little evidence to supported the theory.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Steelpeckers are a non-sentient species of carrion bird native to the planet Jakku. They have beaks and talons that are tipped with iron; they feed mainly on metal, to which they are drawn by its magnetic signature. To digest the metal they consume, Steelpeckers store vanadium, osmiridium, and corundum in their gizzards. Named for their diet, these birds are useful commodities to scavengers, who collect their carcasses and guano.</p>"

The carnivorous amphibians are protected by a tough, rubbery hide of ten-centimeter-thick, brownish-white skin. Although their heads are large, their brains are small. A steep's mouth stretches from one side of the head to the other, with two eyes located on purple stalks protruding from the tops of their heads. Similarly purple-colored growths extend down the backs of the species.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Designated as non-sentient, steeps are known for their lack of intelligence and, when fighting an adversary, will continue attacking relentlessly until they themselves have been killed. Steeps are named after their habit of \"steeping\" themselves in the sewage-filled waters of their homeworld Metellos' seas. The amphibians are frequently seen floating on the surface of the water. Steeps are known to roam down Metellean alleyways at night seeking children for prey.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Stintarils are a speedy, nomadic species of rodent native to Yavin 4, dwelling in the jungle canopy.  They have sharp teeth and a knobby hairless tail used for balance. These rodents attack in swarms.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Stintarils are a speedy, nomadic species of rodent native to Yavin 4, dwelling in the jungle canopy.  They have sharp teeth and a knobby hairless tail used for balance. These rodents attack in swarms.</p>"

They would often resort to threats and torture as interrogation routes. These droids were created to analyze a battle, calculate a possible battle-winning solution, and a time frame to carry out their plan. Being programmed with Separatist beliefs, they ruled through fear and through the lack of courage and hope in their victims and specifically \"freedom from the tyranny of the republic.\" Although Super Tactical Droids were not directly involved in combat, they were able to effectively use self-defense and an E-5 blaster rifle. Being programmed for success, they are willing to kill for the advancement of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.Building off their predecessors, the T-series tactical droid, they had a much more robotic inflection to their voices, as well a larger, more imposing and more damage-resistant body. These droids were also able to better process and adapt to sudden changes and unexpected complications and have more variables in their calculations. Although better than those before them, flaws in their programming were still prevalent. These included the difficulty to see approaches and plans that differ from their own, and the overconfidence in the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its army.</p>"

Swamp slugs are omnivores, eating anything organic that they can fit in their mouths of jagged teeth. The teeth, or radula, lining the slug's esophagus pulverize into organic slime any plant or animal matter that it ingests. An hermaphroditic species, the swamp slugs reproduce sexually. Each partner lays hundreds of eggs, most of which are eaten by other animals. They exude a thick, foul-smelling mucus which damages the breathing organs of other species. They are not desirable to eat by other predators and are given a wide berth in the swamps.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Baktoid Combat Automata manufactured several models of tactical droid, including the T-series tactical droid and a more advanced super tactical droid. Later, L-1 tactical droids would be used during the Galactic Civil War.</p>\n<p>Super tactical droids are advanced tactical droids that had command capabilities during the Clone Wars, acting as generals of the Separatist Droid Army. They would often resort to threats and torture as interrogation routes. These droids were created to analyze a battle, calculate a possible battle-winning solution, and a time frame to carry out their plan. Being programmed with Separatist beliefs, they ruled through fear and through the lack of courage and hope in their victims and specifically \"freedom from the tyranny of the republic.\" Although Super Tactical Droids were not directly involved in combat, they were able to effectively use self-defense and an E-5 blaster rifle. Being programmed for success, they are willing to kill for the advancement of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.Building off their predecessors, the T-series tactical droid, they had a much more robotic inflection to their voices, as well a larger, more imposing and more damage-resistant body. These droids were also able to better process and adapt to sudden changes and unexpected complications and have more variables in their calculations. Although better than those before them, flaws in their programming were still prevalent. These included the difficulty to see approaches and plans that differ from their own, and the overconfidence in the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its army.</p>"

Models of repair droids include the WED Treadwell repair droid, the MSE-6 series repair droid, and the DUM-series pit droid.</p>\n<p>The T3-series utility droid was a Utility droid produced by Duwani Mechanical Products at some point prior to the Great Droid Revolution. They remained popular for years to come and were still the most recent of a long line of physically identical models as of 3956 BBY. Earlier models in the same series included the 3C, IT, and T1 models. Designed to function as a maintenance droid for a variety of mechanical and electronic systems, the T3 was internally more advanced than its predecessors.The T3 droid was originally designed for repair and general maintenance duties and worked at its optimum level aboard starships. As with other utility droids of the era, the T3 unit had four wheeled legs, of which the front two were attached to the droid's blocky chassis by rotating joints, allowing the droid to slide backwards and forwards to adjust the unit's height. The T3's roughly toroidal head featured a large main photoreceptor and two secondary ones, a broadcast antenna and vocabulator that allowed the droid to communicate in Droidspeak. Without periodic memory wipes, these models developed personality and behavioral traits. It was even known for some units to form gangs, making a living as thieves. Others sold their computer-slicing skills to criminals.The sophisticated mechanical and computer training software loaded into the T3 utility droid allowed it to function in the capacity of an engineer or even a copilot aboard a starship, making it a favored purchase for traders and smugglers alike. One common modification was the addition of a starfighter interface package, allowing the droid to plug directly into a specialized slot on a starfighter, granting starfighter pilots the same benefit that transport pilots have come to expect from the T3.Some custom T3 droids also had weapon mounts able to fit a number of readily available blaster pistols mounted in the droid.</p>"

The tank has great maneuverability in tight quarters, such as the streets of occupied cities. Its laser cannons can devastate enemy troops, and the powerful engines can transport heavy payloads. Costing 45,000 credits, the Occupier has a maximum speed of approximately 72 kph on road and 45 kph off road.  It is 7.30 meters long and 1.82 meters tall.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Tauntauns are a species of omnivorous reptomammals who are indigenous to the icy planet of Hoth. Tauntauns are commonly used as pack animals by Hoth's denizens. Tauntauns are also used as patrol mounts since they are so well-adapted to the cold.</p>"

They also have four massive claws on each hand. Their tusks and claws are highly venomous. It is theorized that they were once rancors, subjected to mutations by the Sith, and that when the dark side is weak in the galaxy, they hibernate and remain dormant for many years, only to return when the dark side is strong again. A terentatek's hide is highly resistant - in some cases even immune - to the effects of the Force.

Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds to collect other sentient beings to dump on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport.Bossk, a famous Trandoshan bounty hunter, worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees. He was ruthless and efficient, but upheld the Bounty Hunter Code and was known to keep his promises to the letter of the law. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees.

Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees.

Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees.

Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds to collect other sentient beings to dump on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport.Bossk, a famous Trandoshan bounty hunter, worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees. He was ruthless and efficient, but upheld the Bounty Hunter Code and was known to keep his promises to the letter of the law. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Well-suited for destroying lightly defended buildings, such as Prefab shelters and power cores, mounted troopers' primary role was in attacking hostile combat vehicles such as combat speeders and attack tanks. They accomplished this task by utilizing a flamethrower as their primary weapon. Mounted troopers were usually vulnerable to unmounted troopers and ground vehicles.  Common mounts include Orray form Geonosis, Dewbacks from Tatooine, Kaadu and Tusk-cats from Naboo, Tauntauns from Hoth, Blurrgs from Endor, and Varactyls from Utapau.</p>"

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.

The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.<strong><em>Imperial Army.</strong></em> As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.<strong><em>First Order.</strong></em> The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions.</p>\n<p>Whether clones, conscripts, or academy recruits, the backbone of the central government's war and peace machine are well trained, well armed, and well armored individuals.  Deployed throughout the galaxy to deal with threats to authority, these troopers have various roles and specialties.</p>"

Their distinctive characteristics included sharp horns, long claws and savage teeth. Tuk'ata are unusually intelligent and are even able to communicate with one another through means unknown. It is claimed that originally the species was non-violent and grazing before being corrupted by Sith alchemy experiments that awakened latent parts of their brain which transformed them into unnatural abominations. On occasion, random mutations produce some tuk'ata that are able to live for centuries and grow to immense proportions.Considering that many Sith hounds were sealed inside the tombs themselves, some believe that they are immortal or draw nourishment from the Force itself, the latter part of which is likely true. It is also possible that they survive by feeding on small vermin or other creatures that infest the tombs as decay and time create new openings in the stone walls.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>The tusk cat is a fawn-colored feline predator found on Naboo and its moon Rori. Domesticated tusk cats are naturally protective and gentle towards children, and they are often used as mounts for shepherds and the military.</p>"

Extremely xenophobic & territorial of their native resources, Tuskens often attack the outskirts of smaller settlements. They believe all water is sacred and promised to them, resulting in them raiding moisture farms set up by colonists.Clan groups consist of 20-30 individuals, and are led by clan leaders, tribal chiefs, and warlords. At the age of 15, a Tusken becomes an adult, and had to slay a krayt dragon and cut out the precious pearl found in its stomach. Tuskens inhabit encampments scattered across an area of the rocky Jundland Wastes known as The Needles, which are guarded by vicious massiffs.They wield gaderffii sticks in combat, and use Tusken Cyclers to fire on vehicles they spot. Every Tusken warrior creates their own unique gaderffii stick. Males wear rough wrappings and garments that provide protection and allowed ease of movement. Females can be distinguished by their elaborate jeweled masks with eyeslits and torso-covering sand-shrouds. Tusken children wear unisex cowls and simple cloaks. All Sand People wear mouth grilles and eye coverings to retain moisture and keep sand out. They are forbidden to remove their clothing in front of others, except at childbirth, on their wedding night, and at coming-of-age ceremonies.The Sand People and banthas share a close, almost mystical bond. During warrior initiation rites, a young Tusken is given a bantha matching their own gender[ and learns to care for it, with the pair becoming extremely close as the youth earns a place in its clan. When Sand People marry, their banthas also mate, and, should its rider die, their bantha usually perishes shortly after. If a bantha dies before its rider, its remains are placed in a large graveyard, which is treated with great respect by Tuskens and other banthas.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Extremely xenophobic & territorial of their native resources, Tuskens often attack the outskirts of smaller settlements. They believe all water is sacred and promised to them, resulting in them raiding moisture farms set up by colonists.Clan groups consist of 20-30 individuals, and are led by clan leaders, tribal chiefs, and warlords. At the age of 15, a Tusken becomes an adult, and had to slay a krayt dragon and cut out the precious pearl found in its stomach. Tuskens inhabit encampments scattered across an area of the rocky Jundland Wastes known as The Needles, which are guarded by vicious massiffs.They wield gaderffii sticks in combat, and use Tusken Cyclers to fire on vehicles they spot. Every Tusken warrior creates their own unique gaderffii stick. Males wear rough wrappings and garments that provide protection and allowed ease of movement. Females can be distinguished by their elaborate jeweled masks with eyeslits and torso-covering sand-shrouds. Tusken children wear unisex cowls and simple cloaks. All Sand People wear mouth grilles and eye coverings to retain moisture and keep sand out. They are forbidden to remove their clothing in front of others, except at childbirth, on their wedding night, and at coming-of-age ceremonies.The Sand People and banthas share a close, almost mystical bond. During warrior initiation rites, a young Tusken is given a bantha matching their own gender[ and learns to care for it, with the pair becoming extremely close as the youth earns a place in its clan. When Sand People marry, their banthas also mate, and, should its rider die, their bantha usually perishes shortly after. If a bantha dies before its rider, its remains are placed in a large graveyard, which is treated with great respect by Tuskens and other banthas.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Extremely xenophobic & territorial of their native resources, Tuskens often attack the outskirts of smaller settlements. They believe all water is sacred and promised to them, resulting in them raiding moisture farms set up by colonists.Clan groups consist of 20-30 individuals, and are led by clan leaders, tribal chiefs, and warlords. At the age of 15, a Tusken becomes an adult, and had to slay a krayt dragon and cut out the precious pearl found in its stomach. Tuskens inhabit encampments scattered across an area of the rocky Jundland Wastes known as The Needles, which are guarded by vicious massiffs.They wield gaderffii sticks in combat, and use Tusken Cyclers to fire on vehicles they spot. Every Tusken warrior creates their own unique gaderffii stick. Males wear rough wrappings and garments that provide protection and allowed ease of movement. Females can be distinguished by their elaborate jeweled masks with eyeslits and torso-covering sand-shrouds. Tusken children wear unisex cowls and simple cloaks. All Sand People wear mouth grilles and eye coverings to retain moisture and keep sand out. They are forbidden to remove their clothing in front of others, except at childbirth, on their wedding night, and at coming-of-age ceremonies.The Sand People and banthas share a close, almost mystical bond. During warrior initiation rites, a young Tusken is given a bantha matching their own gender[ and learns to care for it, with the pair becoming extremely close as the youth earns a place in its clan. When Sand People marry, their banthas also mate, and, should its rider die, their bantha usually perishes shortly after. If a bantha dies before its rider, its remains are placed in a large graveyard, which is treated with great respect by Tuskens and other banthas.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Twirrls area carnivorous, mammalian falconid species, native to Naboo.  The Twirrl prey upon plain-dwelling avians, small rodents, and Naboo's four-legged waterfowl. </p>"

Wars, cruel empires, criminal syndicates, and the predation of terrible beasts can destroy whole towns and force their inhabitants to become beggars, vagabonds and brigands. All who endure such hardships are hardened by their losses, staring at the face of danger and saying, â€”no more!â€”, taking their protection into their own hands.<strong><em>Unity is Strength.</strong></em> Fear and resignation are the strength of beasts and tyrants, despair is the fuel of revolt. Despair makes you stand and fight until the last sentient. When abandoned by lords, Jedi and the Force, the common man turns toward his neighbor for mutual protection. If separately they are no match for a beast or a trained trooper, an entire village or town banding together and fueled by despair, faith or hatred can take down their foe. Theses masses can become a force to reckon with, embodying the proverb â€”unity is strengthâ€”. A crowd can potentially include several individuals of high power, which would be left standing or escape once the crowd disperses.<strong><em>Crowd Mind.</strong></em> Racist pogrom chasing wookiees down the streets, slaves fighting for their freedom and ousting a tyrant, or commoners taking to the streets to protest the emperor; all are good examples of a crowd. A crowd is moved by its own motivations and the individuals that form it can differ widely, but once the crowd mind takes them, they act in unison toward a single purpose. Reasoning with a crowd can prove difficult, as the behaviors of both the individual crowd members and the crowd is heavily influenced by the loss of responsibility of the individual and the impression of universality of behavior, increasing with the size of the crowd.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it. When a crowd drops to 0 hit points the crowd disperses into a number of humanoids based on how large the crowd had been. Alternatively, a large crowd such as a riot or an uprising could deescalate into a smaller crowd type when it drops to 0 hit points or has fewer than half of its hit points remaining.</p>\n<p>An uprising can encompass countless numbers and only an army or a group of incredibly powerful individuals could hope to stand against a crowd of that extent. An organization mustering such numbers has a planetwide, and perhaps galactic, influence, gathering members from many regions into a single location. A entire city or metropolis revolting could provide the numbers for an uprising, spreading over several districts and into the countryside.<strong><em>Dispersing a Crowd.</strong></em> Defeating a crowd doesn't mean killing any single individual, but instead breaking the resolve of the crowd and dispersing it.

                    "value": "<p>Ysalamiri are furry, lizard-like tree-dwellers about 2 feet in length, native to the planet Myrkr, and most known for their ability to create a Force-neutral bubble. This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Veermok are large, ferocious primates native to the swamps and woodlands of Naboo. They hunt Jimvu and young Hrumphs through stealth and surprise, using powerful claws for gouging and grabbing.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>Abeloth, also known as the Bringer of Chaos and Beloved Queen of the Stars, is a being very powerful in both the dark the light sides of the Force. She first lived as the Servant, a mortal woman who served the powerful Ones on an unknown jungle planet over a hundred thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. Over the course of her life, she became the Mother: she kept the peace between the Father's warring Son and Daughter and became a loving part of the family. But she was still mortalâ€”she grew old while her ageless family lived onâ€”and she feared she would lose her precious family. In a desperate attempt to hold onto the life she so loved, she drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge. Her actions corrupted her, transforming the Mother into the twisted, immortal entity known as Abeloth.<strong><em>Loneliness.</strong></em> Abeloth is antagonized by loneliness; she feels an absolute need to be loved and adored. She has fed her cravings by instilling in Force-sensitives a desire to be with her, and in turn catered to their every need and assumed the role as their mother. This need stems from her original fear of losing her family. When her family abandoned her on their planetâ€”the very reason she committed her crimes in the first placeâ€”she was driven insane by loneliness and despair. She feeds on fear and destruction in an attempt to gain more power; her ultimate goal is to recreate her lost family. She may try to force players to drink from the Font of Power, attempting to make replacements for the Son and Daughter.<strong><em>Appearance.</strong></em> Abeloth has the ability to change her appearance at will. However, Abeloth's true form is that of a humanoid and barely-female being with deeply-sunken black eye sockets and tiny silver eyes reminiscent of tiny stars at the bottom of a deep well. She has a long cascade of straw-like, honey-blond hair that reaches to the ground and a large, full-lipped mouth that stretches from ear-to-ear and contains needle-like teeth. Her arms are stubby, protruding no more than ten centimeters from her shoulders, with hands that had long, writhing tentacles for fingers with suction cup tips. Her body is rigid and straight, and when she walks or runs, her legs ripple forward more than they swing. In addition, her body may be enshrouded in mist, giving her an ethereal aspect to her already frightening appearance.<strong><em>Powers & Abilities.</strong></em>  Abeloth's strength in the Force is a dozen times that of the most powerful Force user in the galaxy.  She wields exceptional telekinetic powers, being able to release waves of Force energy that cause beings in her vicinity to implode, those farther away to be ripped to pieces, and buildings to melt to the ground. She is also able to teleport herself from one place to another. Abeloth can produce a Force-flash, affecting the visuals of ships in an entire star system. Abeloth can command the native flora of her planet.  She has the ability to influence the minds of Force-sensitive beings who have spent an extended period of time in the Maw, causing a psychosis which makes them believe that everyoneâ€”except for other such psychotic beingsâ€”has been replaced by impostors and instilling in them a desire to find her. <strong><em>Possession.</strong></em> Abeloth is capable of possessing or absorbing the consciousness of beings in order to further enhance her power. Abeloth is able to take on the physical appearances of beings that she has consumed, and she is also able to project images of other beings.  She prefers to inhabit the bodies of Force-sensitives, as non Force-sensitives' bodies fail to last for long before deteriorating.  However, her dependency on avatars may ultimately be her greatest weakness: killing a significant number of avatars in her possession appears to result in her strength weakening such that her manifestation may be defeated. <strong><em>Imprisonment.</strong></em> For thousands of years, Abeloth has been imprisoned in the Maw, which is a cluster of black holes artificially created by Centerpoint Station and maintained from within by Sinkhole Station.  These stations are believed to have been created by the Celestials.  Abeloth's release from the Maw may be due to a number of reasons including the destruction or compromise of Sinkhole Station, or by a Current of the Force being altered and the flow of time changing. <strong><em>Defeat.</strong></em> If enough of her avatars are defeated, Abeloth's primary manifestation, usually in and about her home planet in the Maw, may be defeated in combat.  Such a Force entity cannot be \"truly\" killed by normal means. It is thought that, if defeated, Abeloth would return: perhaps in one hundred years or perhaps in one hundred thousand years. However, it is believed by some that the Dagger of Mortis would be capable of killing Abeloth permanently. Additionally or alternatively, Abeloth may be contained by recreating the prison of the Maw or by some other equivalent means. </p>\n<p>None</p>"

It is one of a number of intelligent plants from the world, a category of which included the Bafforr tree.The vesuvague tree, though rooted in the earth, is able to detect and move itself towards motion by sensing air vibrations in its leaves and ground vibrations in its roots. In order to catch its prey, it uses its quickly growing vines and roots, capable of extending multiple meters in mere seconds, to seize, strangle, and crush its food. Once a creature is dead, the tree buries its vines and roots inside of its prey, and slowly feeds off of its bodily fluids.The tree can be trained to respond to simple commands, much like a pet, and can understand words by using its leaves to sense the vibrations and patterns of spoken languages.</p>"

Some models are equipped with a self-destruct mechanism in order to prevent those whom it had been sent to observe from studying them and determining their source, as well as a small blaster-type weapon for defense.</p>\n<p>The Viper Probe Droid is a deep-space exploration and reconnaissance probe droid produced by Arakyd Industries. The probe droid is equipped with a blaster cannon and a self-destruct mechanism. The lightly-armored Viper droid measures 1.6 meters in height with six manipulator arms extending from a central pod and several retractable sensor arms for gathering samples. High resolution receivers and sensors cover the domed headâ€”including motion, acoustic, sonic, and seismic sensors, a radiation meter, magnetic imager, and holocamera. It has an atmosphere sensor capable of determining a planet's atmosphere class within one half-hour. It moves on a repulsorlift generator which is equipped to operate over any terrain. One of the arms is high-torque, and the droid is equipped with a floodlight on its head. Information is relayed back to superiors via a high-frequency HoloNet transceiver. Vipers are delivered to their targets through single-use custom built hyperspace pods. They are commonly deployed along the perimeters of key strategic star systems and hyperlanes to act as automated guardians.Typically, a Viper probe droid costs 14,500 credits. <strong><em>History.</strong></em> Many thousands of the Imperial Viper probe droids were manufactured on Mechis III, and were in production when the rogue assassin droid IG-88 took control of the planet's automated factories. IG-88 included a secondary set of programming into the Viper droids to relay any obtained intelligence back to Mechis III, as well as to the Empire. Thus, they simultaneously served as the eyes and ears of the Droid Revolution. The Imperial Intelligence's Analysis Bureau also used them as remote surveillance droids posted largely in the Outer Rim Territories. In conflict zones, probots often worked alongside the Imperial Navy to monitor traffic and provide early warnings of attack. They could also be programmed to engage pursuit mode, whereupon the Viper would track an enemy vessel and report back on its location and destination.<strong><em>Variants.</strong></em> Arakyd's success with the military model of the Viper yielded the C-Viper probe droid variant designed for planetary law enforcement organizations, the Infiltrator probe droid for sabotage missions, and the Hunter-Killer probot.</p>"

Vornskrs were also used as guards in the Dark Force Temple on Dromund Kaas.  The Yuuzhan Vong used the species as a biological template for the voxyn.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Vornskrs are primarily nocturnal hunters, and use their whip-like, mildly venomous tails to stun prey before finishing them off with their teeth. They are normally sedate during the day, but hunger or other factors may drive them to hunt during daylight hours.<strong><em>Lightsaber Form.</strong></em> Before Jedi Master Mace Windu refined it into Vaapad, the Form VII style of lightsaber combat was referred to as the Way of the Vornskr.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

Designed to hunt and kill the Force-sensitive Jedi of the galaxy, the reptilian hounds are all clones of the voxyn queen.<strong><em>Biology.</strong></em> The cells of voxyn deteriorate at a rapid rate if they are not exposed to a nutrient from the planet Myrkr, and as such, voxyn in other parts of the galaxy typically do not survive for more than a few months. Voxyn are naturally sterile.<strong><em>Characteristics.</strong></em> Standing one meter high, mature voxyn measure over four meters in length and are reptilian in appearance, although warm-blooded. A pair of oval yellow eyes with excellent night vision are located on the voxyn's flattish head, which has a broad snout over six inches long filled with fangs, and its lithe body is covered in black or green scales and sports eight clawed legs. The toe pads house a hundred deadly retroviruses, whose medium is the green slime that covers the voxyn's claws.A series of sensory bristles covered in a powerful neurotoxin run down the creature's spine, ending in a whip-like tail that has a white, poisonous barb on it. The poison causes swelling and makes most creatures' flesh red for one to six days. The tail's barb can also be used to deliver a neural shock. Voxyn also have long, forked tongues and are able to shoot out of its mouth a jet of brown, acid-like saliva that burns anything it touches. The creatures can also emit a sonic blast from their snouts, sending a compression wave that can temporarily disable a person's hearing, make them feel nauseous, and shatter eardrums. Voxyn's purple blood, when exposed to air, becomes a neurotoxin that smells like smoke and ammonia. Voxyn are fast and agile on their feet, able to jump to great heights, and can swim in and under water. Voxyn possess the ability to sense Force-sensitives through the Force. Jedi can sometimes feel voxyn as well, registering the creatures as a hungry or feral presence. However, voxyn can hide their presence from Force-sensitives.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Vulptices are a non-sentient species of omnivorous and gregarious canids from the mineral world Crait. They are distinguished by their coats made up of white crystalline bristles. Vulptices have excellent low-light vision and keen senses. They are omnivorous, feeding on tubers and small burrowing mammals they dig out from under Crait's salt crust. According to Doctor Paqin Mesoli, who wrote field notes on the vulptices for the Nupayuni Mining Consortium, these creatures might also be sensitive to magnetic fields.</p>"

                    "value": "<p>A droid starfighters are automated starfighters that are droids themselves, instead of being a vessel piloted by another creature or droid. They were used prior to and during the Clone Wars, having the great advantage that if the ship was destroyed lives would be spared. There are several types of droid starfighters like Hyena-class bombers, Vulture droid starfighters, and Droid tri-fighters. Several of these fighters are capable of ground-based locomotion and combat.</p>\n<p>The Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I, also known as the Vulture-class droid starfighter, or more simply as the vulture droid, is an unmanned model of droid starfighter manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering and utilized by the Trade Federation and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Constructed in the cathedral factories of Xi Char, their creation through precision manufacturing is considered an act of religious worship.Like the ground forces made up of battle droids, vulture droids are sometimes remote controlled by a control ship.  However, later generations of the fighter are able to operate with limited independence due to the installation of artificial intelligence. They are also known to be able to communicate with each other by chattering. While not in flight, vulture droids can transform into walking mode to patrol the surface or provide support during battles, and are specifically designed to fill both space and ground-based roles.The vulture droid carries four blaster cannons and two energy torpedo launchers, and can reach 1200 kilo-meters per hour in a planet's atmosphere. In walker-mode, the Vulture-class could only use its two torpedo launchers as its cannons were situated on the legs and pointed downwards. While in this mode, the droid starfighter can also latch onto surfaces in zero gravity, allowing it to launch directly from the external hull of a capital ship. Vultures are also capable of being programmed to self-destruct if their link with their host control ship is severed.Vulture droid starfighters are usually named by a six-digit designation number, consisting of DFS- and a three-digit alpha-numeric combination, as illustrated by the fighters DFS-1VR and DFS-4CT.</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible.

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Woodoo are massive flightless reptavians indigenous to Tatooine.

They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably comes in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grow long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranges from blue to brown. Wookiees are big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.Wookiees have extendable claws which they use for climbing; using them for anything else violates the Wookiee honor code. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees are regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees are known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees have a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years. <strong><em>History.</strong></em> The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws under the Empire ultimately led to classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient. The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions. As a result, many Wookiees were forced into slavery building much of the Imperial war machine, sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel, or on construction sites such as the Death Star. Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings, hunted for sport, or forced into gladiatorial combat.  Some of these wookiees turned towards darker pursuits after their rough treatment, such as the infamous bounty hunter Black Krrsantan.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably comes in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grow long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranges from blue to brown. Wookiees are big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.Wookiees have extendable claws which they use for climbing; using them for anything else violates the Wookiee honor code. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees are regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees are known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees have a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years. <strong><em>History.</strong></em> The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws under the Empire ultimately led to classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient. The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions. As a result, many Wookiees were forced into slavery building much of the Imperial war machine, sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel, or on construction sites such as the Death Star. Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings, hunted for sport, or forced into gladiatorial combat.  Some of these wookiees turned towards darker pursuits after their rough treatment, such as the infamous bounty hunter Black Krrsantan.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably comes in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grow long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranges from blue to brown. Wookiees are big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.Wookiees have extendable claws which they use for climbing; using them for anything else violates the Wookiee honor code. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees are regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees are known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees have a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years. <strong><em>History.</strong></em> The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws under the Empire ultimately led to classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient. The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions. As a result, many Wookiees were forced into slavery building much of the Imperial war machine, sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel, or on construction sites such as the Death Star. Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings, hunted for sport, or forced into gladiatorial combat.  Some of these wookiees turned towards darker pursuits after their rough treatment, such as the infamous bounty hunter Black Krrsantan.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They have brown, warty skin and measure 1.5 meters in height. They are quadrupeds with dexterous forelimbs. A worrt's head features a pair of sensitive cranial palps; two bulbous eyes, yellow in hue; two nostrils; and a large mouth containing a long tongue and strong teeth laced with a venom potent enough to kill a bantha. Worrts lay large amounts of soft eggs, which are harvested for food and used as ingredients in drinks such as Jabba Juice.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Worrts feed mostly on insects and rodents. When hungry, a worrt settles into the sand, becoming indistinguishable from a rocky outcropping, and waits for prey to pass. When its victim comes close enough, the worrt throws its tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around the prey. The worrt's tongue then snaps back, throwing the food down its throat.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

They have large claws at the end of their feet and sharp teeth, making them dangerous to the unwary. They also have two small back legs.<strong><em>Behavior.</strong></em> Wraids are often seen in clusters from two to six members. Generally, they will not harm passersby unless provoked, at which point their danger becomes immediately apparent.<strong><em>Hunting.</strong></em> Because of their ferocious appearance and short temper, they are a popular quarry of less-experienced big game sport hunters from around the galaxy. When the settlement of Anchorhead was founded, hunting wraids developed into a marketable trade with the opening of hunting lodges and salespeople dealing in wraid skull plates purchased from hunters.Their skull plates are rumored to have medicinal uses, but the market for them is very specific.</p>\n<p>None</p>"

This ability evolved in response to predation by the Force-sensitive vornskrs. Many ysalamiri grouped together would expand their Force-neutral bubble by varying distances â€” sometimes by kilometers.Ysalamiri sink their claws into the Olbio trees on which they live and draw nutrients. It is very difficult to remove a ysalamir from its tree without killing it, although this has been known to happen. Some few have developed back harness or nutrient frames which allow transport of the ysalamiri and, therefore, their Force repelling bubble. Ysalamiri do not actually negate the Force; since all existence is infused with Force energy, this would not be possible. Rather, they project a bubble inside which users are unable to exert any influence over the Force. A single bubble measures a few meters in diameter; large groups of ysalamiri could extend their collective bubble by kilometers, but only in great numbers.Miriskin was a commodity  made from ysalamir skin.</p>\n<p>Zalaacas are swift, intelligent, and fierce omnivores native to the Gungan swamps of Naboo.Rather little is known about their habits. They seem to dwell primarily in woody uplands, yet are strong swimmers. Narglatch will not attack adult-sized zalaacas.</p>"
