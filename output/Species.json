                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Bith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.</p>\n<p>The other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Bith are one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, \"younger\" species. Their society is highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Bith names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Fedu, Jenkiss, Kabadons, Ph'teumkiass </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Duhia, F'hubama, R'hothal, Thidus </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'intes, Hern, K'sarorn, Nimum, Rumo</p>"

Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards. </p>\n<p>Bothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Bothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse'dra. In this \"Bothan Way\", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as \"ar'krai\". When engaged in ar'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Male bothan names are often trickey while female's are soft. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Garc, Hibriak, Nith, Tramom, Ventagt </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Ceerriah, Dhaim, Gnam, Meenn, Vit </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bwif'livi, Gra'kit, Hia'faitu, Main'dil</p>"

Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.</p>\n<p>The Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the \"Blood Hunt,\" in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Cathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are usually one syllable.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Crurbirr, Isyrr, Nynorr, Suro, Tukarr </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Cuwin, Jyvohr, Mulahr, Solyri</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Jin, Ki, Mak, Rhir, Ta</p>"

The binary structure of Cerean thinking helps them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Cereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean's daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool. By focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions are eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment. Cerean Jedi sometimes incorporate these crystals into their lightsabers, providing great focus, even during intense physical combat.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Cerean male first names are often hyphenated, while females are not.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The chiss are a near-human species distinguished by their blue skin and glowing red eyes. Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Crorcu'ecuk'unist, Dash'esoru'ishur, Jerd'ecer'lonii, Kisk'egauw'eqhi, Marag'aliphil'eduo, Pommo'icuote'nlerme, Vornu'wuzi'lerdim</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>A bipedal mammalian species, Devaronians evolved in the dense jungles of Devaron as a hunter-gather species. Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Cir, Gremegris, Keirtihk, Kucx, Niruhk</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Crilnuy, Ghal, Milma, Nola, Taoluel </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Breiz, Droddost, G'vaulnel, Raokt</p>"

Their form and color scheme vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner.</p>\n<p>They are noteworthy for their distinct, function-oriented form.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class II droids are programmed for engineering and other technical sciences. They differ from class one droids because they apply the science to real-life situations. Class II droids are rarely equipped with Basic vocabulators, instead communicating through Binary. There are five subcategories of class II droids. Astromech, exploration, environmental, engineering, and maintenance droids are all class II droids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation. Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.</p>\n<p><strong>Designations (Names).</strong> BB-5 (Beebees), CH-33P (Cheep),  OC-JK14 (Seejay), PT-7 (Poot), RG-G1 (G-G)</p>"

They are usually a polished metallic color, though this can vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner.</p>\n<p>They are noteworthy for their slow, shuffling gait and typically overly talkative nature.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class III droids are programmed to interact with humans. They are said to be the most advanced droids ever invented. Protocol, servant, tutor, and child care droids are all class III droids.</p>\n<p>They are usually equipped with protocol chips which give them the cognitive functionality to engage socially.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation. Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.</p>\n<p><strong>Designations (Names).</strong> K-OHN (Kone), I-5YQ (I-Five), O-MR1 (Omri), TC-14 (Teesee Fourteen)</p>"

They are usually colored to match their affiliation, though personally owned class IV droids might not be. Certain models of class IV droids, such as the HK-series, are made to look like class III droids to disguise their martial nature.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class IV droids are programmed for military and security purposes. Such droids tend to perform tasks of violence or combat might be expected. Almost all class IV droids carry weapons. Armed combat droids are among the first droids ever created. Security, gladiator, battle, and assassin droids are all class IV droids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearence</h2>\n<p>The duros are humanoids with smooth blue-green skin, red eyes, lipless mouths, long thin noseless faces and green blood. Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Their home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.</p>\n<p>The duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.</p>\n<p>With their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Duros names are generally melodic, with female names having softer intonations. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Cir, Fod, Mom, Rur, Zim</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Chochi, Fumsu, Kaleshef, Raada</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dektuks, Jimoks, Silt, Tuzig, Zhoks</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ewoks are sentient humanoid mammals, averaging about one meter in height, which can provide an advantage when trying to hide. They are covered in fur from head to toe, with brown and black the most common colors. Other Ewoks have near-white or reddish fur, but red fur is supposedly the rarest shade an Ewok can get. Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to \"little bears,\" though they are sometimes referred to as \"mini Wookiees.\"</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a \"Central Village\" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.</p>\n<p>Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ewok names are comprised of growled consonants. Female names always end in a vowel. Surnames are clan-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Coostick, Erphek, Grarphil, Moodoo</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Booshi, Chela, Fesasha, Lipe, Ypezzi</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Fedrimra, Jellyng, Moomrack, Trantelaa</p>"

Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ark, Blarrp, Blubrak, Cuab, Shos</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Dabrisz, Mernoos, Ogreb, Tagorq</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Doofnarq, Griks, Lurc, Poogmokk</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans develop into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons. Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Gungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.</p>\n<p>If a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gungan names are often repeated syllables hyphenated.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Crinn-Crinn, Gic, Noc-Noc, Wal</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Hew, Khi, La-La, Phro-Phro, Yuss</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Baud, Gos, Jalles, Mag, Wub</p>"

They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as \"humanoids\" because of their structural resemblance to humans.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of humans with their own cultures, such as the Alderaanians or the Pamarthens. Humans are the most populous species in the Galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Humans are the most populace species in the Galaxy, and thus their names vary drastically based on the planet or culture with whom they reside.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Koth, Liorz, Satapak, Tin, Vuc</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Dhetia, Jhilk, Risha, Thinnih, Tonu</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Jauli, Kudi, Melmi, Windu, Wobec</p>"

They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships.

They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their \"Law of Life.\"</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ithorian names are quite varied in length but most names are soft and melodic.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese. Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.</p>\n<p>The jawa's unofficial motto is <em>not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it.</em> This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Jawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their time around other species respond well to nicknames. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are clan based.</p>\n<p><strong>Male names.</strong> Bilvu, Mnak, Penk, Plin, Vih</p>\n<p><strong>Female names.</strong> Bahimos, Kola, Levu, Rhovi, Uvet</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Kkejenem, M'avoe, Tjoteelt, Wiamoel</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearence</h2>\n<p>The mon calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the mon calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots designed for human-like feet. The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The mon calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy. Mon calamari literature depicts stars as islands in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated; once a mon calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. They often fixate themselves on \"lost causes.\" </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Mon calamari names generally have a melodic feel.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Creaz, Fior, Hurneerth, Nurrins, Sielpa</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Afwa, Lel, Mhirim, Ri, Theya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dualda, Gradi, Tua, Valec, Winab</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Nautolans possess physiology common to amphibious species, including low light vision and excellent swimming skills. Their bony endoskeleton and dense cartilage make them tough and resistant to glancing blows. An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The society developed by the Nautolans on Glee Anselm is centralized around local families and governments. The centralized government of Glee Anselm is comprised of representatives from the Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful politicians as well as the most aged members of the society. A culture that promotes life-long mates, Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the household. Arranged marriages are not uncommon. </p>\n<p>No cultural affinity for the Force ever developed on Glee Anselm, though members of the Nautolan species recognize its importance and respected those among them that were Forceful.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Nautolan names are generally short and melodic. Female names usually end in a vowel. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Brod, Knirkoc, Peng, Tikuwik, Zesufreat</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Doli, Hahi, Thamlymyo, Usha, Zezu</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Iarre, Rirrall, Sompanong, Uzumdall</p>"

They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture. Eventually, having driven most of the other predators on the planet to near extinction, they began to hunt each other in various wars and gladiatorial contests.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Female names tend to be longer than male names. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dagon, Dwedd, Gweym, Steech, Xeep</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Heebmu, Iissi, Teezle, Whunam</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bluchosso, Encekserr, Gieeseaagg</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Sith are a proud and violent species of humanoids that evolved on Korriban, a planet within the Horuset system in an isolated Outer Rim region called the Stygian Caldera. Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive. </p>\n<p>Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply \"My Lord,\" or some other epithet, by their underlings.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aqorzum, Khashai, Sihmot, Wirjol</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Aqurwia, Cliriu, Nupax, Ubhesosiuth</p>"

Young togrutas' montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Togruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and  band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Togruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Acanaar, Mukraas, Obolak, Tokrym</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Hyl, Na, Nim, Ris, Resh, Vaal, Zin</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Trandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bossk, Tshyrrng, Varrsk, Wuikkekss</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Aksa, Idwiks, Kluks, Mezuus, Shokss</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dallosss, Druc, Groqisch, Hsac, Nausdot</p>"

From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.</p>\n<p>Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds. Tuskens do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ur Ur, A'Koba, Qeruru'rr, Gr'Karr</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> K'Yark, Reirin, K'Orou, Ursarr'u</p>"

Twi'leks are omnivores; this diet is essential given that food is scarce on their homeworld, Ryloth. Twi'leks possess multiple stomachs, an unusual trait that enables them to eat almost any food. When traveling off their homeworld, twi'leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi'lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi'leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth's harsh environment. A number of twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi'leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Twi'lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ecrizsati, Gaj'mogos, Ukelweko</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Arag'mure, Oanicfuba, Unaecripi</p>"

Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.</p>\n<p>Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as \"Weequay\". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Chublu, Fah, Kreakk, Og-Rollo, Yurrenn</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Gila, Qommi, Palsa, Sex, Xelror</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Britreg, Dlur, Klanz, Maub, Semu</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of \"family\" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a \"honor family.\"</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Zabrak are near-human, but have a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.</p>\n<p>In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.</p>\n<p>Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species' overall value throughout the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet. Zabraks don't use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Kadro, Muraa, Neqama, Ruvroo, Xadra</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Blostopa, Mega, Novrar, Rebroke</p>"

Typically well-muscled, the abyssin's stooping gait results in a slightly hunched appearance. </p>\n<p>A distinctive trait of the abyssin is their ability to heal quickly; their fast regeneration is believed to have been an adaptation to prevent fluid loss via bleeding on their desert homeworld. All cells in the abyssin body are replaced every 80 hours, and organs which typically were paired in other species appear singularly.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>A primitive tribal society, the abyssin of Byss are known as violent and brutish, and their planet is avoided by most beings in the civilized galaxy. Unstable resources on Byss do not allow for mass population growth or for the stabilization of a central government, economy or trade system. </p>\n<p>Existing simply in nomadic tribes, abyssin groups can interact peacefully with one another, though only if both groups have plentiful water and food supplies. Otherwise, they began a 'Blooding', a brawl that ends only when one tribe's warriors are all killed, captured, or incapacitated. Warriors who survive a Blooding are usually allowed to join the winning tribe once they finish their regeneration. This tradition led to some violent incidents when spacers tried to make first contact and trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water resources, especially since the abyssin assumed the alien traders could regenerate as quickly as they did. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>There does not appear to be any distinction between male and female names for abyssin. Abyssin don't use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Anami, Easym, Myo, Qawohl, Seh-run, Sidie</p>"

Evolving into a class of reptomammal, advozsec have a single horn at the crown of their heads, four digits on each hand and foot, pointed ears, and large eyes. Advozsec are strictly vegetarian, unable to properly digest meat. The geothermal hot springs that appear on their homeworld forced the species to evolve thick skin in order to survive. The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor's skies. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Since so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Advozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Dleck, Fjemm, Gorde, Rollar, Xon</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Ghantere, Leventraim, Timack, Vy, Zimda</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The aing-tii are a species of sentient, toothless mammals who stand on two clawed feet with two spindly arms, each with three large digits. Their bodies are covered in jointed white, bony plates covered in unique painted motifs. The aing-tii head is small and juts out perpendicularly from their chest, featuring two large eyes and six long, thin, green tongues extending from their mouths. They have a long, prehensile tail. The species is incapable of producing sound and conveys information via tasting, smelling and touching each other with their tongues.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The aing-tii are native to a planet whose location in the Kathol Rift is a closely guarded secret. Although in a dangerous area of space, the majority of Aing-Tii never leave their homeworld nor have any contact with the outside world. Those who do—commonly called aing-tii warrior monks—are often xenophobic and reclusive. The monks spend their entire lives performing errands for their gods, in the hope that they will receive \"an answer\" from them. The aing-tii hate slavery, and often attack slavers who roam the Kathol Outback.</p>\n<p>While the aing-tii are Force-sensitive, they avoid wielding the Force, which they see as sacred. The aing-tii believe that everything is somehow guided by the Force. They do not believe in the light or dark sides of the Force. Instead, they hold that there are many different aspects to the Force.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Aing-tii names are, in reality, non-verbal and only truly understandable via taste, smell, and touch.  The few aing-tii who have been known to the outside world have used translators to convey an auditory identifier. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ben'Sur, Looshen'Fel, Tadar'Ro</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kulan'Pa, Laman'So, Te'Nuriel </p>"

Aleena's bodies are long compared to their short arms and stubby legs. Warm-blooded reptiles, they possess exceptional reflexes as well as a fast metabolism which allow them to convert food into energy very rapidly in order to escape predators on their harsh home planet. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Aleena are social and tend to thrive best in with close-knit teams if not with their own kind. They develop strong loyalties to friends and protect those they care about fiercely. Due to their inborn curiosity, the aleena are stereotypically galactic travelers, tourists in every sense. This, combined with their strong dedication to their relatives, results in aleena families traveling even to most unusual and dangerous locations just to see its sights. The appearance of aleena family walking through an intergalactic metropolis is a common sight on many planets. The aleena's love of sports and particularly, adventure and thrill sports, draw many into the galactic community. Most who enter professional classes are experts or diplomats. </p>\n<p>Aleena settlements were small, and most individuals were part of a single lineage, or tahiko. The leader of each tahiko led the community, and represented their wishes to the planetary advisory body. The advisory body elected a king to govern the planet, and was generally revered as a religious figure as they led religious ceremonies. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Aleena names are generally short and guttural, with longer names being saved for royalty. Surnames are based on their tahiko, or tribal lineage.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Batts, Gratz, Wakka, Zakan, Zetts</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Arkei, Harza, Sutci, Tsuon, Yenn, </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Anares, Kylar, Ors, Practes, Targae</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Anomid are a species of humanoids with translucent, purple-hued skin that is smooth but wrinkles with age. They have large, slender hands with six fingers on each: two end fingers, two center fingers and two thumbs, with a sharp claw on each. The fingers are paired in twos and slightly spaced apart from the others. The eyes of the anomids are solid, with no visible irises or pupils and have been seen in varying shades of yellow or blue. The anomids have pointed, fin-like ears that protrude from the sides of their heads. Anomid hair is often long and well kept, and is always found in shades of black, gray or white.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Anomids almost always wear elaborate masks which cover most of their faces. These are not breath masks, but vocalizer units. Since anomids have no vocal cords, they rely on these vocalizer masks to communicate with other species. These masks are often elaborately customized to reflect an anomid's social status, family origin, or profession. Among themselves, anomids communicate using an elaborate sign language. Anomid sign language requires six-fingered hands, which makes it difficult for humans or human-programmed protocol droids to use.</p>\n<p>Anomid civilization has a long history of pacifism and technical achievement. In fact, most Anomids are pacifists—historians believed that no major wars have ever been fought in the Yablari system.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anomid names are usually one or two syllables long, featuring hard consonants. Female names are often softer, with a greater flow to them. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Arkis, Jarak, Magris, Vell </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Apharis, Eralie, Siphanie, Ulaniye </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dekan, Krest, Narroc, Quill, Wode</p>"

Originating from a world with higher-than-average gravity, the anx possess a stooped stature. Their heads are tall and blade-shaped, with a soaring crest which acts as a sinus cavity. While their crests change color to reflect their moods, its primary function gives anx a low rumbling voice. An anx's large, muscular tail serves as a counterbalance for running.</p>\n<p>Anx have long necks and limbs, and would appear taller if they didn't walk with their shoulders stooped and their crested heads held out in front of them.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The anx are serene giants who assume many roles in the Republic. Evolving from herd animals, the anx are a placid, sociable race known for developing a near fanatical interest in groups they related to. Living in complicated clan structures, anx enjoy the company of their large families and are more comfortable in groups. </p>\n<p>An innate trait among the anx is a formidable knowledge of anatomy, especially in regard to nerves, muscles and bone structures. Due to this extensive knowledge, even by species they have never encountered, the anx are considered dangerous unarmed combatants and skilled warriors, capable of incapacitating opponents with a single, well-placed strike.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anx names are less harsh-sounding compared to those of other reptilian species. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Drexol, Graxol, Horox, Theen</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kendiula, Madurrin, Pipalidi, Quiyya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Fida, Jur, Kelvyyn, Ryyd</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the Aqualish people have two facial tusks which curve down over their mouths; a trait which added to their appearance as arachnids. These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.</p>\n<p>While Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Aqualish names are intended to sound strong. Surnames are not familial, but are chosen by each individual Aqualish.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bung, Gu, Opege, Soni, Tubop</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Cestirki, Duni, Iftu, Sifre, Umi</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dogomurra, Julo, Kronem, Nidoal, Utix</p>"

Cona is always hot, and has very little water, but the atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. Arcona adapted to this environment by eating the ammonia-converting roots of flora as a source of water. Arcona depended on the ammonia to live and, as a result, arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements. Despite their large eyes, arcona have very poor eyesight. Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes. Often mistaken for their nose, this organ detects heat patterns from living beings. Thus, arcona can recognize things by its heat pattern.</p>\n<p>Arcona are highly susceptible to addiction to spice and common salt, which serves as a hallucinogen with effects resembling that of intoxication. Their eyes shift to gold after prolonged addiction.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Arcona normally think of themselves not as individuals but as a collective whole. Largely forsaking individuality, they often refer to themselves as \"we\" even when alone. The arcona live in loose, family-based communities called nests, which are ruled by a Grand Nest. Because arcona are born in nests underground, they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with siblings. Males raise the young, since females are typically impulsive thrill-seekers. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Arcona names are quite diverse, named by their fathers in the nest. Surnames are either familial or nest-based. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bijrik, El, Jat, Kazat, Onalol, Shle</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Ak, Cimam, Cuten, He, Madan, Omik</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Cheen, -drell, -faxel, Shran, Takonak, -voll</p>"

They are covered in fur from head to their wrists and ankles, with brown and grey being the most common fur colors. Ardennians sport four arms and prehensile feet. All six of their limbs are equally dexterous.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Ardennian people themselves are a friendly communal species that are well known for welcoming visitors and inviting newcomers to traditional feasts and dances on the sandy beaches of Ardennia. Rural Ardiennan's live in modern tree-villages in the thick, dim jungle canopy on the majority of the islands. Ground level accommodations are available for off world visitors even in the smaller villages. Most off-worlders stay in the large modern resort complexes which boast having miles of private beaches or in the modern cities. Several large cities exist, scattered around the world, which typically encompass an entire island or a series of smaller islands joined together.</p>\n<p>Ardennia's distance from the main hyperlanes makes it one of the lesser-known vacation destinations, but it's a popular one for those who don't mind the extra travel time. Some affluent visitors prefer the solitude that Ardennia offers, and occasionally end up purchasing one of the smaller islands to build their own home. Ardennia is notable for having the most beach per square meter in the galaxy. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ardennian's names are typically concise and rarely more than two syllables, with a familal surname.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Rio, Jakar, Hul, Lup, Quil, Jerno</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Rac, Bras, Nuc, Kua, Karta, Sanya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Betal, Durant, Jabut, Karon, Rambuan</p>"

This proved helpful on their dark and frigid homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many must wear blinders on planets with hotter, younger suns. It is not unheard of for arkanians to undergo genetic or cybernetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than \"lesser\" species.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Arkanians are notoriously arrogant, a trait which came from generations of producing some of the galaxy's greatest advancements in genetics and technology. Their homeworld, Arkania, has vast quantities of precious gems; thus, the arkanians have never wanted for much in trade. This wealth went into funding their ambitious scientific projects, the most elaborate of which take generations to be completed. </p>\n<p>Many arkanians have come to see their species as the pinnacle of evolution, and amongst the most—if not <em>the</em> most—intelligent beings in the galaxy. Those species that are not already put off by their aloof nature often fear them, as tales of \"mad scientists\" and horrific experiments tend to surround them.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Arkanian names are simultaneously dignified and succinct. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Arkoh, Hyrim, Zeta, Suprin </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Shenna, Elizie, Cratala, Hanna </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Focela, Barzane, Nasdra, Athacorr</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Physically similar to humans, balosars appear to be sickly and gaunt when compared with the galaxy's most common species due to the heavy pollution of their homeworld. The most striking difference between balosars and humanity is a pair of antennapalps which sprouts from underneath the thick, coarse hair on their skulls. Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force-sensitivity. Balosars also possess an acute tolerance for poisonous substances, a byproduct of life on their toxic homeworld.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Early in its history, the balosar homeworld was overrun by galactic megacorporations eager to exploit the world's lax ecological protection laws. The planet was home to the balo mushroom, a key ingredient in death sticks, one of the galaxy's most infamous narcotics. After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.</p>\n<p>Since there is little opportunity to flourish on their homeworld, balosars often leave in search of fortune elsewhere. Their natural resistance to the lethal—but not the addictive—effects of the drug encourages some to enter the death stick business.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Balosar names have a slight exotic tinge to them—often because Balosar parents name their children while on a death stick high. Their surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Barin, Elan, Fantes, Zerba </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Delaana, Ferrika, Reki, Vetyl </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Cher'dak, Mer'darro, Sel'Sabagno</p>"

Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many startled foes. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which can grow to be 2 inches in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the massive amount of food they required to survive.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Living in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where the group thrives and hunted from. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess; many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal. They also have a great deal of respect for the Jedi because of their first experiences with a Jedi Master who settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy, are an unknown concept to Barabel and are considered insulting.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Barabel names are harsh and gutteral. Female names are often softer. Surnames are warren-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Anidroks, Bridiz, Trurzuk, Vilzinok</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Alge, Bulzo, Ekthamo, Inako, Nolku</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Akken, Dutarca, Khigta, Srabulgid, Zhomo</p>"

Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell give the species enough sensitivity to detect another being's mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent. Despite this fact, the baragwin frequently keep this intelligence hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Baragwin culture, since it does not derive from a single homeworld, is highly dependent on a baragwin's planet of origin, with Tatooinian baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight. Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Baragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don't differentiate by gender.

The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Because of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.</p>\n<p>While not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business. Trading and making deals, any violence on these stations is committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Besalisk name's are generally words that embody them, with a surname attached to their commune.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Darius, Dexter, Plun, Pong</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Delia, Mora, Ren, Teen</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Jettster, Kil, Krell, Ugg</p>"

They have long arms with three-fingered hands, and pointed ears which stick out from the sides of their heads. They also have extremely acute senses of smell, with their nose positioned at the end of a tooth-filled snout. Caamasi have the interesting ability to share vivid memories called memnii with their near relatives and Force-sensitives. A memnis is as vivid to one who receives it as it was to the one who participated in the event remembered. Their peace-loving natures are in part due to memnii, as having a memory of killing or harming will be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time, and something caamasi will seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept their burden.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>A pacifist race, culture on Caamas evolved around the basic tenets of peace and social justice; influencing the evolution of the Jedi Order. Working as explorers, diplomats, and artists, the caamasi are a monogamous people who value single partners while mating and starting a family. However following the devastation of their homeworld by the Empire, caamasi who were off-world at the time considered evolving to a position of polygamy so as to regrow the population. While the argument is one of survival, many sociologists familiar with the culture of the caamasi believe that they will not accept the idea.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Caamasi surnames are often composed of two parts, with the second part designating clan membership.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Althanic, Gelerit, Ryg'gos, Shren</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Eeshraq, Heshrisa, Nulana, Yr'na</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> A'kriy, I'tela, O'Tul, Sho'cyl</p>"

The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other species, though the Chadra-Fan could readily tell the difference using their powerful sense of smell. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan's children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home.</p>\n<p>Chadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chadra-Fan names do not vary significantly based on sex. Surnames are clan based.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong>  Dubi, Kattar, Naska, T'yabah, O'yasha</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Abalomm, Fandy, Nemm, Nuz, Yedit</p>"

During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs develop. Adult Chagrians are truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possess acute low-light vision.</p>\n<p>The average Chagrian stands taller than a Human. They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males' strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>As a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bom, Chen, Fiet, Nedd, Touk</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong>  Chavik, Dabai, Fisil, Oolya, Tinto</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Kassin, Molya, Nigna, Onirali, Treen</p>"

Combined with their intellect, this makes them skilled hunters of animals such as backshin, because they can smell out their prey or feed while keeping their eyes on the horizon. It is also their hunting prowess which allowed them to dominate their homeworld and conquer the Chevs. Chevin have thick legs, massive wide bodies, thin rope-like tails, and arms so long their three-fingered hands often brushed the ground.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Chevin live in small, mobile communities, with homes mounted on great wheeled carts. Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.</p>\n<p>The only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements are movable when necessary. Each of the roughly two dozen Government Villages rules a Chevin nation.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chevin names do not vary significantly based on gender. Surnames are based on community.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Buula, Ephant, Perre, Phylus, Reseros</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Meh, Mon, Nen, Needmo, Phrusaani</p>"

A chironian can sit down by folding his or her horse-like legs underneath the body. Chironians can also kick backward with both hind legs; this strong kick is sufficient to knock over other beings. A chironian's pace can vary between a walk, a canter, and a gallop.</p>\n<p>Each year, chironian heads grows two horns above the temples. These horns start as small knobs covered by red-furred velvet: a vascular tissue. Once the knobs have grown sufficiently, they break through the velvet naturally, emerging as transparent horns, as bright as diamond, cool to the touch and with smooth ridges. However, if the velvet is cut artificially, chironians can die from the injury. Over time, the horns grow long and sharp enough that adolescent chironians can use them to gore opponents.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Chironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves: when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tap them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade. Young chironians, when frightened, are known to rub or press their velvet-covered horns against the foreheads of other beings to whom they are emotionally close.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chironian names are soft and melodic, despite the thick nature of their native language. Important family names are passed down through generations. They don't use surnames. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Jefin, Slaturn, Cinall, Leathes</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Olachi, Luna, Sinall, Trespen</p>"

They have sunken cheeks with a narrow nose, a small mouth, large eyes with slit-like pupils, and a thin line that runs down their foreheads, creasing their nose. Clawdites possess an extremely rare ability to change their appearance. They can change the color and texture of their skin and eyes, and even grow hair, to mimic other species, though they cannot add significant physical mass to their bodies. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>By nature, clawdites are quiet and solitary beings, often shunning the company of others unless it benefits them. Due to their nature as shapeshifters, they are often mistrusted by strangers. Consequently, they view the galaxy pragmatically, and are often harsh realists.</p>\n<p>Not all clawdites use their shapeshifting abilities due to the pain the transformation causes. These clawdites are often inclined to remain on their homeworld of Zolan, avoiding the company of other species.</p>\n<p>On Zolan, clawdites are feared and shunned by the zolanders, who are a deeply religious people, believing that clawdites are impure and sinful. Zolanders force clawdites to live in slums scattered across the planet.</p>\n<p>Those clawdites who leave their homeworld tend to gravitate toward professions that celebrate their shapeshifting, such as smuggling, bounty hunting, or espionage.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Clawdite names often have a rolling or hissing quality to them.

While their hair, eye, and skin pigmentations tend towards earthen hues, brighter colorations such as blonde hair or blue eyes, though uncommon, also exist. Rarer still, some adults maintain a light coat of fur or elongated, pointed ears. These eccentric attributes result from their unusual childhood forms.</p>\n<p>Codru-Ji children are actually sapient, six-legged canid creatures that cannot speak. Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty. At that point, a blue, rubbery substance cocoons a Wyrwulf for several weeks before it emerges as a humanoid adolescent. They do, however, retain both the natural resilience and the enhanced hearing of their previous selves.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Codru-Ji are proud and protective of their ancient customs, and they carefully manage their homeworld's economy to keep a degree of anonymity from the galaxy at large. They fear the tainting of their long-held practices by outside influence as well as prejudice against them for the almost barbaric level of callousness they will display towards one another in pursuit of personal gain. The kidnapping of a political rivals' children or the ransoming of off-worlders back to their people are both common practices. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Codru-Ji names are often kept to two syllables. Clan names are appended to the given name as a hyphenated affix.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Kossok, Tirrit, Uttar, Yunnan</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Davvi, Kella, Russa, Zollu </p>\n<p><strong>Clan Names.</strong> -Fa, -Mu, Ro-, -Sy, Yi-</p>"

A colicoid's physiology allows them to curl up into a protective ball and unfurl suddenly which allow them to catch their prey unaware. This rolling method of locomotion is second nature to the colicoids. Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks. </p>\n<p>Some members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds. This makes them extremely dangerous and are the only colicoids that possess a unique poisonous stinger. This combined with their strength and size makes them deadly combatants, especially when within their nests. However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Though highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices. They are noted for being vicious and calculating creatures that are driven by greed whilst showing little regard for others. The colicoids have numerous successful commercial ventures and hold strict business protocols. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Colicoid names are typically very short and gender neutral, with surnames being based on the queen from which they spawned. </p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Gal, Het, Kaf, Lyp, Nok, Yin</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bek, Dor, Set, Tel, Wim, Zal</p>"

Their long snouts are not truly proboscises, but function much the same, allowing them to drain blood with the aid of two tendrils, one on either side of the snout. They move by crawling about on their hands and feet, and are adept at leaping and climbing.</p>\n<p>Despite their appearance, culisetto are an exceptionally hygenic species, with an evolved habit of rubbing their hands and legs to rid them of germs from the ground.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Culisetto are often shunned by other species, if not for their grotesque appearance, then usually for their habit of drinking blood. They prefer to do so while their victims are alive, but tolerate it if they are recently dead. While they have evolved beyond needing to drink blood to survive, its taste remains quite enticing to many culisetto, who will indulge in it at their pleasure.</p>\n<p>Culisetto tend to favor the company of their own kind, particularly their siblings. Broodlings frequently travel in groups of three or more, inseparable from birth.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Culisetto names are distinctively antiquated in their etymology. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Kreon, Sosilu, Ocyto, Phino</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Hecuba, Anophe, Xeina, Adeia</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dengue, Chontos, Kazan, Vazil</p>"

Defel have the ability to bend waves of light in such a manner that it renders them practically invisible to the human eye. Despite this ability, they could be still be spotted by force-users and keen-eyed individuals.</p>\n<p>Defel have extremely high perceptive ability because of their large ears, sensitive noses, and keen eyes. Because of the heightened levels of visual stimuli their eyes experience, defel are nearly blinded by sunlight but  can see rather well in the dark.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Defel live in tight-knit, interdependent communites underground. The harsh environment on Af'El turned the defel into rugged survivors, able to hold their own in the Galaxy. </p>\n<p>Defel have a strong sense of honor and will not associate with individuals that do not keep their word.</p>\n<p>Because defel have yet to achieve interplanetary travel, they are a rare sight in the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Defel Names</h2>\n<p>Defel names tend to sound dark and mysterious, and are mostly composed of multiple syllables. Defel surnames are familial, using stern and simple sounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Alustair, Claustro, Tenebris, Varsiin</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Lhantra, Soliel, Stroika, Zavtra</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Gauss, Neura, Tume, Vecherom</p>"

Diathim have been known to survive in the vacuum of space without the need for protective gear, and have a mild hypnotic effect on others in their presence, adding to the legends surrounding them.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The diathim give off an aura of kindness, and are consistently described as benevolent by spacers, causing tales of their rare appearances to morph over time into the grandiose mythology of the \"Angels.\" The diathim are reputed for their beauty, and the way in which they appear varies depending on the beholder. Diathim are fascinated by spacecraft, which often prompted them to mob any ships that found themselves in the vicinity of their homeworld Iego and its largest moon Millius Prime.</p>\n<p>Diathim have only commonly been seen gathering in flocks to welcome arriving ships, and knowledge of their habitat remains a mystery to outsiders. Although they have no apparent language of their own, they have readily adopted Galactic Basic, the common language of the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Traditional diathim names are difficult to pronounce. When among other species, they tend to simply go by shortened nicknames for others to refer to them by.</p>\n<p><strong>Birth Names.</strong> Aiubhirr'merh, D'yz'xarh, Ihuithrhe, Vyxendel'ahitraxr</p>\n<p><strong>Nicknames.</strong> Mirra, Diz, Huu, Vix</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Dowutin species evolved from a type of omnivorous herd animal on the planet Dowut. They were large, aggressive-looking humanoids with chin horns, sharp claws, thick skin, and had poor eyesight but superior senses of hearing and smell. Dowutin are massive humanoids who can live for centuries, and dying of old age is unheard of for them. While most other species become frail as they age, Dowutin never stop growing and getting stronger. As teenagers, Dowutin resemble Wookiees in size and strength, but by their fifth century, they are a mountain of muscle weighing a metric ton, with loud footsteps and voices warning other species away.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Dowutin are a very straightforward people, and their society is among the most simple in the galaxy. They have few cities, governments, or even organized social structures, as they often survive entirely on their own. Children are left behind by their families at a very young age and must learn to fend for themselves. Because of this, those who quickly learned hunting skills survived. Their size and strength made them prized as hired muscle, but most Dowutins' pride dissuaded them from such work, as they viewed other species as weak, absolutely refusing to take orders from anyone who is physically weaker than them. As such, those who employ Dowutin will command them in more subtle ways, typically phrasing their commands as suggestions or advice. Strength in the literal sense is very important to them; it is a measure of worth and earns them respect. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Dowutin names are harsh and guttural, and roll off the tongue like a rock slide. Dowutin do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Dursuc, Grimgorl, Maucro, Tornak</p>"

The Draethos' culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens. Consequently, despite their reputation as fierce combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld are peaceful and intellectual.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Due to their lack of lips, Draethos names typically lack hard consonants.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Dugs are slender, powerfully built beings with a somewhat humanoid build and a unique method of walking that hailed from the high gravity world Malastare. Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Due to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.</p>\n<p>On their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Dug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful. Surnames are usually passed down through family or clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Bawugri, Gadwouhx, Rorgukwa, </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Bosix, Grugne, Jiwous, Pragiba, </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Brundaare, Gninsaidi, Kedwir, Randaine</p>"

This is no biologicial trait inherent to the species, but rather stems from the fact that combat is so ingrained into every level of echani culture; the echani hold to the idea that combat is the truest form of communication, and to know someone fully, you must fight them. While their combat rituals require complete freedom of movement and unarmed martial arts, in warfare, they tend towards light armor and melee weapons, and are considered excellent craftsmen of such.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Echani names tend to lack hard consonants, but are otherwise as variable as human ones.

They also have small black eyes. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>In terms of society, their race's culture resembles that of a hive society though each individual retain their own thoughts and aspirations yet all being bred for a specific role that they were eager to fulfill. A caste system is present amongst the esh-kha which included Force-sensitive simple minded savants, more numerous skilled determined warriors that watched over them and finally the patriarchs that acted as leaders who provided their wisdom as well as decisions to their entire people. Esh-kha appear to outsiders as a savage violent species that care only for the destruction of all other races. This hatred for other sentient species is believed to had stemmed from their tightly-knit hive-like society. It is suspected that the esh-kha are simply unable to tolerate or even adapt to the existence of thinking of outsiders who only suffered their wrath. Their race only turns violent against one another in the most extreme of circumstances.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Whilst their kind are individuals, esh-kha are not named at birth but instead earn their names through their actions. An esh-kha that displayed great skill in battle could be called \"Swift Blade\", or maybe \"Deadly Cutter\" or some other such name. It is believed that this partly explained an esh-kha's zeal in battle with young warriors seeking not only victory but an opportunity to lay claim to a name and forge their own identity. Esh-kha do not use surnames, as they believe they are one family.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Bleeding Yell, Dormant Heart, Blue Survivor, Ancient Cull, Sharp Grip, Running Sun, Flame Walker</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Falleen are distinguished by their mottled green or red skin, ridged skulls, and their long, black hair which they typically wear in ponytails. The sleek symmetry of their features, calculating and cold demeanors, their exotic looks, and their ability to alter their skin pigmentation make the Falleen often considered to be among the most aesthetically pleasing beings in the galaxy. In addition to their strikingly beautiful appearance, the Falleen exude pheromones which makes them all but irresistible to both sexes.</p>\n<p>The Falleen are semi-aquatic, being able to hold their breath underwater for an extended period of time. Fallen are one of few species that are resistant to manipulation by the Force.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Falleen society is of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower classes. The upper echelons of Falleen aristocracy are rife with politics and intrigue, though they rarely spill blood over disputes or reduce themselves to open warfare.</p>\n<p>As a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control, particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control. Indeed, the Falleen as a species have a towering sense of superiority, reflecting on their view of Falleen as the civilized and cultural center of the galaxy, rather than Coruscant.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Falleen favor names with Z and X sounds. They are usually accompanied by a surname, which is familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Xomit, Xizor, Xist, Zenex, Zurros</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Xora, Trezza, Mylla, Zule, Annaz</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Grunseit, Croom, Moz, Xiss, Mythric</p>"

The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Felucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.</p>\n<p>The Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.</p>\n<p>All Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains. These shamans are very strong in the Force, using it to their own ends with incredible skill.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Felucian names are usually two syllables and full of hard consonants.

A life above ground and in caves has led the flesh raiders to lose their more amphibian traits, and are now more humanoid in their biological needs, though they seem to only be able to digest meats and flesh.</p>\n<p>Flesh raiders keep many of their ancestral rakatan features, though they have experienced a form of gigantism that has lead to their interesting appearance, that of a flat topped, spade shaped head, with blade-like eye stalks coming off the side ends of the spade. Their body structure also more closely matches that of a trandoshan or dashade, being bulky and imposing in stature, towering over most other sentient creatures.</p>\n<p>Unlike contemporary rakata, flesh raiders did not lose their ability to tap into the Force.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Flesh raiders are known to form small clan structures, with a war boss in charge of the clan. Those flesh raiders who are born Force-sensitive can be found imitating a temple structure, with a powerful Force-sensitive, usually from another species, leading them. </p>\n<p>Flesh raiders still speak the rakatan language, though it has developed into a cruder variant.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Flesh  raider names tend to be short and concise, embodying strength and virility. Flesh raider names make no distinction between male and female names. Surnames are clan-based, though they are rarely used.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Cha'nagh, Fashk, Gorshh, Keshk, Mar'govrok</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Ban, Fel, Kuir, Penk, Teeshk</p>"

The natural armor allow the Gand to shrug off injuries that would cripple most other species. The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Gand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all called \"Gand,\" as they are considered merely aspects of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner of speaking is common within the spoken and written Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to outsiders.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Until a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term \"Gand.\" Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves \"Gand\" until they prove themselves again. Male and female names are not distinct.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> C'nyir, Dash, Iglid, Kyuffax, T'rix</p>\n<p><strong>Surname.</strong> Diqlu, Krakee, Praafri, Quudya, Zooq</p>"

The typical member of the species has a face that is squared-off and yellow in color, the expression trapped in a perpetual snarl that non-ganks find unattractive. Small, mean-looking eyes peer from above the maw, their head sitting atop a thick neck between broad, strong shoulders. These cap two thickset, powerful arms, which terminate in hands with five fingers each. Their heavy build affords ganks great strength, yet they are also spry runners. They augment their bodies with cybernetics, making them a species of cyborgs.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Precious little is known about gank culture. The exception is that the ganks are fabled for their violent and ruthless nature; even the slightest perceived insult is enough to throw a gank into a violent rage of retaliation. Outsiders similarly know little of the organization of gank society, or whether they have any central rulers at all. What is well known was that the ganks are a war-loving and regimented species, whose members enjoy occupations that allow them to fight and shed blood, such as that of assassin, bodyguard, bounty hunter, and mercenary. They are in particular demand by the hutts, who have enough ganks on retainer to constitute a small army. Their warlike ways and physical strength ranks the ganks among the galaxy's most redoubtable fighters. The species have no compunctions about premeditated murder, which lends them the nickname \"Gank Killers.\"</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gank names do not differentiate between genders, and instead of surnames, they give themselves epithets. </p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Darakk, Frent, Shett, Yorrath</p>\n<p><strong>Epithets.</strong> the Feared, the Keen, the Slayer, the Tough</p>"

Geonosians are strong despite their thin builds, and are capable of constructing massive hives and factories in concert. The head of a Geonosian is elongated and large with their skulls ridged on the top and by the side where they have bulbous, thick-lidded eyes. Both are physically strong and covered with bony ridges which protected their arms, legs, and vital organs. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Geonosian society is caste-based with little upward mobility, though some of the lower caste do develop ambition. Workers are conditioned to loathe even the concept of separation from their hive and the system of control. A low-ranking worker's normal life is one of endless toil and labor to satisfy the aristocracy, who are known to make spectacular demands. The warrior caste tend to be highly competitive and are eager to prove themselves. They are born with an abnormal level of intelligence, and one of their only hopes of escape from their rigid duty is entering voluntarily into gladiatorial combat. Should they survive, they are granted freedom. Ultimately, their society exist to benefit those few members that reside in the upper caste. Members of the aristocratic classes are known to be ambitious, domineering, and manipulative. They constantly move towards improving their standing and holdings while sumultaneously working to ruin their rivals.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Geonosian names are usually harsh sounding.

Upper caste surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Buck, Goshey, Nik, Sozz, Techtu</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Datte, Kida, Miri, Nare, Tenessi</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Chak, Hor, Lur, Marpes, Zol</p>"

Their facial features include many sharp downward angles, large triangular eye sockets, and sloped-up brows that meet together in the middle, lending them an appearance of permanent anguish. Because of the harsh environment of their homeworld, the Givins' organs are sealed against atmospheric exposure; thanks to this complex system, they can survive for about a day in a vacuum.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>In order to survive their homeworld's lunar tides, the Givin became extremely adept at calculating the trajectory of their celestial bodies. Over the ages, Givin have become so skilled at celestial navigation that they are able to calculate hyperspace jumps in their heads. As such, mathematics have become a cornerstone of Givin society. Two Givin will often greet each other by exchanging complex equations for the other to solve.</p>\n<p>Due to their profound mathematical ability, Givin are skilled starship builders and astrogators. They create some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek ships in the galaxy. However, they frequently build their ships without the presence of a navcomputer or pressurization system, and so their buyers have to add these system in the starship aftermarket.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Givin names are often derived by parents from favored mathematical equations. Male and female names do not significantly differ. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Daggibus, Lersia, Na-Soth, Nisil, Sladru</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Alarin, Nalas, Narth, Larr, Scoritoles</p>"

They have clawed, three-fingered, frilled hands, and tend to possess a muscular build. Females are slightly shorter than males and lacked a whorl located above their nose. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>An aggressive species, the gormak hold an innate love of warfare and competition, and are extremely hostile towards the other natives of their planet, the voss. The gormak hold a belief that in order for them to prosper, the voss, whom they view as a plague on the planet, must be destroyed. To achieve that goal, warriors have repeatedly assaulted the voss capital city over the course of centuries; however, despite their far greater numbers, their nature has kept them from uniting against their enemy. While their society and speech are considered primitive by galactic standards, their innate talent with technology rivals the top minds of the galaxy. From bits of scavenged electronics and equipment, the gormak construct advanced tools, heavy machinery, specialized weapons and even cybernetic implants. However, despite their incredible affinity for technology, the gormak remain a pre-spaceflight culture confined to their homeworld, which causes them to be viewed as a backward species despite being perfectly capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gormak are commonly named after heroes of their history by local shamans.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Gotals possess cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones can sense the natural electromagnetic fields produced by Antar 4's magnetite-rich crust, allowing the species to operate even in total darkness. Their senses also pick up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms. When close to their hunting targets, they can ascertain information on its mood, awareness, and state of mind. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals; in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings, making them notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on their cones, with their eyesight and hearing being quite weak, and their sense of smell almost completely absent. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Since their natural empathy makes them instantly sensitive to the feelings of others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld, resulting in problems when dealing with other societies. No central authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a whole in a crisis, and no organized Gotal military or police force can act on their behalf. Other species respect the Gotals for their discretion and restraint, but some individuals fear interacting with the horned beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed to others.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gotal names are quite guttural, though there are also many harsher tones within their names. Gotal names do not vary significantly based on gender, and surnames are familial. </p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Thon, Fern, Fuu'rash, Jir, Vluphol</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Gratlul, Klux, Vathon, Zilat, Krigh, Rahxem</p>"

They have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even able to see into the infrared, thus they are able to sense one another's emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen. A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society. </p>\n<p>The Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran are educated for a specific job that best served his or her talents.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Gran names typically are monosyllabic and accompanied by a surname, which is familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ask, Dree, Ree, Pax, Nic</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Yan, Alijia, Meeb, Sir, Zeek</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Moe, Leem, Yees, Wix, Naaq</p>"

These arms are covered in thick hair and end in three-fingered hands.</p>\n<p>The Harch are distantly related to the Aqualish species and there is much debate among geneticists regarding the relationship between the Harch and the Aqualish Ualaq subspecies. However, the Harch themselves considered such discussions to be obscene.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Not much is known about the Harch, as few of them have mingled with the galactic community, preferring to stay on Secundus Ando. Harch that leave the planet tend to have a more aspirant nature than their fellows, and often reach great heights in their chosen professions in the galaxy. Such Harch are considered outliers—most apparently care little for titles.</p>\n<p>Like the Arcona species, female Harch are seen as more domineering and aggressive than their male counterparts.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The herglic are a massive race of creatures descended from aquatic mammals, breathing though a blowhole on top of their heads. They are tall and wide, and have smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale blue to black, though some rare individuals may appear pink or have white markings on their sides. Their girth tends to leave them feeling out of place among smaller species; herglic tend to take up two chairs or fill the entire doorway of any establishment they enter that does not cater to beings their size.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The herglics are very technologically advanced, developing space flight and hyperdrives and colonizing their sector of the galaxy prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic. Natural explorers and traders, they sailed the cosmos establishing crucial trade routes and gaining prestige. Despite their size, herglic are surprisingly dexterous while working with tools, and are some of the finest engineers in the galaxy. </p>\n<p>Herglics have an inquisitive but practical nature, enjoying travel and having exotic experiences. Their perpetually calm demeanor  helps them interact with most other species peacefully, though when dealing with smaller species, herglics tend to become nervous and self-conscious about their proportions. They also seem to have an innate predilection for gambling and games of chance, which have gotten more than one herglic into trouble on several occasions.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Male names are typically harsher sounding than female names. Herglics rarely use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Biglu, Melchi, Sehvorah</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Mahg-Raet, Seese, Uddn</p>"

Ho'dins are, on average, over nine feet tall—nearly a full head taller than wookiees. Renowned throughout the galaxy as botanists and healers, the ho'din claim an ancestry derived from the plants of their home planet, Moltok—in fact, \"ho'din\" translates as \"walking flower\" in Galactic Basic. They are, in fact, reptilian, as their natural climbing skills and cold-bloodedness seem to indicate, and boast a second heart to enhance their survivability. Their \"snake hair\" is temperature-sensitive, allowing ho'din to sense changes in ambient temperature.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Ho'dins are known to be self-conscious and vain, particularly when it comes to their looks and their work, and do not take criticism or insults well. Their religion, Dinante Fli'R, is centered around worshipping and communing with nature, a trait that has sent many ho'din out into the galaxy to rejuvenate damaged planets. The ho'din have an aversion to technology and avoid surface mining and manufacturing, opting instead to dwell in trees. They have learned to make incredibly advanced pharmaceuticals and gardens using their botanical skills to concoct natural medicines, some of which have cured plagues on distant worlds.

They are very powerful due to their large bulk of pure muscle. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The houk have well-earned reputations as bullies, cheaters, and backstabbers. They are often compared to wookiees because of their great strength and violent disposition. Houk are humorless, short-tempered beings who use their strength to antagonize weaker beings. Their propensity for deceit and skulduggery is matched only by the hutts. Though their tempers are not as explosive as those of wookiees, houk are known for their tendency to solve problems violently. In politics, they will often wage war without formal declarations, negotiate in bad faith, and ignore treaties. Though this preference for violence tend to cause the houk problems in dealing with other societies, it often gets them what they want. Surprisingly though, in personal combat, houk prefer to use stealth rather than direct confrontation. This gives them a reputation for deceit and cowardice. However, just as each houk colony has a different culture and government, houk individuals have varied personalities. Though all houk come from a culture with high levels of corruption and violence, many houk are hard workers who have learned to get along with other sentients. The houk produce little technology of their own, though they adapt themselves to the standard technology of the rest of the galaxy. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Houk names are gruff and primitive in nature, and don't vary by gender.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Agamor, Krelba, Morg, Roath</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Krin, Nar, Vogog, Voss</p>"

They have three lungs and thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy. Hutts often have watery eyes and lack facial expressions.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine.  Despite their legendary size, hutts start out as tiny huttlets less than half a foot in height, and continually grow over the long lives.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Most hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like spice smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting. This is not true for all, however, as some eschew the life of a decadent, obese version of their species and prefer a more mobile existence. Hutt society is divided into families known as kajidics, a social structure that is both familial and a crime gang.</p>\n<p>Hutts are encouraged to make a name for themselves around the age of 150 while simultaneously not threatening the welfare of the clan.  At around 200, they will likely stop being saved by the clan and encouraged even further to fend for themselves while benefiting the kajidic; they may even be granted a star system or two.  Nomadic or kajidic-less hutts are often hunted or killed by other hutts in fear of the nomad coming to claim a territory.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Hutt names with a suffix title as \"the Hutt\" are usually reserved for noteworthy huts, with the name of a hutt's kajidic coming before the title.  Because hutts are hermaphroditic, choosing a gender at will, their names are considered androgynous.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Arok, Gorga, Jabba, Mama, Ziro, </p>\n<p><strong>Kajidic Names.</strong> Besadii, Desilijic, Fenn'ak, Gnuda</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Iktotchi do not have hair, but rather they had a very resistant skin which protected them from the violent winds which crossed the satellite. Both males and females have down-curved cranial horns, which gave them an aggressive aspect. The males' horns are generally a little larger, a remnant from their mountain-dwelling, caprinaen ancestors. The horns are able to regenerate if damaged.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Iktotchi are a fiercely guarded and isolationist species - vaunted for their ability to hide their feelings and bury any semblance of emotion. Originating on the harsh, windy moon of Iktotch, which orbits the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region, the Iktotch are gifted with precognition, and are courted as often by Jedi as by pirates for their skills.</p>\n<p>Iktotchi society is a stratified society. Upward mobility is both possible and encouraged. Iktotchi are an outwardly dispassionate people, which is evidenced by their culture. They have a robust legal system, and suffer little crime. Iktotchi are respectful of cultures other than their own and can easily integrate with others.</p>\n<p>Iktotchi who distinguish themselves often earn a titular nickname, by which they are referred to in place of their name. Generally, this is done by accomplishing a remarkable feat that benefits the Iktotchi as whole.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Iktotchi names are generally two syllables. Surnames are familial. Respected Iktotchi often adopt a nickname, which they use in place of their birth name.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dilnam, Imruth, Kashkil, Yellam</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kemkal, Onyeth, Reshu, Zorlu</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Hevil, Kaawi, Mimir, Nudaal, Zelend</p>"

The kage have a long-time conflict with the belugans, consistently at odds with them. During the Clone Wars, Otua Blank ordered the capture of Pluma Sodi to marry her, she was later given back to the Kage Warriors by Asajj Ventress. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The kage are a dedicated people of physical excellence; they train tireless and elite fighter-monks known as Kage warriors. They tend to use weapons with electric or disruptive properties, but they are also great fighters in unarmed combat. Kage warriors are respected in Kage society as the greatest calling a kage might follow.</p>\n<p>Kage also share an affinity with animals, most notably the native multi-legged milodon, developing a symbiotic relationship. They use the milodon as transport; they can keep pace with the subtram transports that supply belugan strongholds, and launch raids that often catch the belugan security forces off-guard.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kage names are generally multisyllable with melodic intonations.

Kallerans are tall and flexible; their hands and feet have three prehensile digits on each, which leeds kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of kallerans have green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species have dense muscles that assist them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies. The kalleran head is distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augment a kalleran's hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antenna crowning their head. These antenna are sensory organs that serve as olfactory and aural receptors. Kallerans have lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration is done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin can draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system requires them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they do not primarily breathe through their mouths, kallerans did not evolve noses.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Above all else, kalleran's value personal achievement over collective accomplishments. Because of this, the people of Kaller have never united to form great societies or participate in galactic affairs. Much of the cultural expansion on Kaller was brought by colonists, both friendly and violent, who had settled the world over the course of millennia.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kallerans have regal sounding names, sometimes using accents on vowels, with clan-based surnames. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Gliconn, Orcas, L—vern, Seelv—n</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Cybele, F—ress, Numarin, Retesh</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Alash, Byssus, Estair, Lash</p>"

The almond-shaped eyes of kaminoans are also able to see color in the ultraviolet spectrum. While female kaminoans are bald, males possess headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous skulls.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The kaminoans see themselves as a superior form of life, but nevertheless remained polite to outsiders. To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society. Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction. </p>\n<p>Kaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the kaminoan's eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks. Although it is extremely rare, kaminoans are sometimes born with green eyes. Those are viewed as genetically inferior and as a threat to the kaminoans' well ordered society and as such are exterminated shortly after birth. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kaminoan names typically are composed by around two syllables and a brief surname.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Lama, Ni, Orun, Koa</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Taun, Ko, Nala, Kina</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Ha, Su, We, Sai, Wa</p>"

Their shark-like heads have pointed noses, gill slits, and many rows of razor-sharp teeth, which they use when attacking and eating. Karkarodons are skilled and fast swimmers. They attack by grabbing the target and used their jaws for ripping and tearing.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Karkarodons hail from the planet Karkaris, which is located in a star system neighboring the planet Mon Cala. They harbor an intense hatred for the Mon Calamari and Quarren inhabitants. The planet is almost entirely under water, and is very uninviting to non-Karkarodons. </p>\n<p>Karkarodon culture is a warmongering, strength-based culture. Clans often fight eachother for dominance, natural resources, and to cull the weak. Each clan on the planet has a ruling triumvirate, usually comprised of venerated warriors who rule for life. When a younger Karkarodon wants to replace one of the ruling body, they challenge them to single, mortal combat. Occasionally, the challenged may spare the life of the challenger when they win, though that usually leads to resentment from the loser.</p>\n<p>Karkarodons do not believe in lying or duplicity. They believe in approaching problems head on and saying what they mean, and are generally demeaing towards those they deem their lessers.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Karkarodon names are harsh and gutteral. They are generally one syllable. Surnames are clan-based rather than familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aurb, Rend, Riff, Trak, Vour</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Dewb, Garr, Rast, Scrat, Zend</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Alben, Gerdall, Kibben, Tamson, Zendall</p>"

The biggest visual difference between the two is that the kiffar always wear tattoos, that represent their clan. Kiffar are more likely to be Force-sensitive, which is typically manifested in psychometry, a rare Force power that about one percent of the kiffar population can use. Using psychometry, kiffar can touch objects and receive visions from the Force that show them the object—s past. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The kiffar reside on the planets of Kiffu and Kiffex. Kiffar are a people who value their own independence, staying out of galactic affairs and being ruled only by themselves. They see outsiders as dangerous and are generally nationalists. They are organized into clans, and clan heritage is very important to them. Their markings, which they call qukuuf, are passed down through the family maternally, but kiffar with a human mother will typically use their father—s tattoos. Conversely, clan membership is passed down paternally, and those with a human father can join their mother—s clan. The traditional colors of the facial tattoos are red, yellow, and green. Various patterns and designs are used to identify the clan. </p>\n<p>Kiffu Guardians, also known as the Guardians of Kiffu, are an important kiffar institution that acts as a police force in their space. The Kiffu Guardians wear black armor, and they share a symbol with clan Vos, which is a gold five-pointed star outlined by a circle. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kiffar use names similar to those of humans, varying drastically clan by clan. Surnames are familiar. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Kurros, Sathran, Vis, Ziflos</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Grai, Ian—, Kinnas, Sonti</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Gov, Keffane, Mullisa, Vel</p>"

The exoskeleton also contains a number of spiracles which served as their way of breathing. Typically, these Human-sized hive creatures have four arms with each ending in a powerful three-fingered claw. They stand on two stout legs that are capable of leaping great distances. Killiks can communicate with other Killiks through use of pheromones.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Killiks have a communal society, with each and every Killik being in mental contact with another. Due to their hive mind, every Killik nest is virtually one individual. Killiks are also peaceful in nature. Their telepathic connection is capable of extending to other species which includes non-insectoids. A willing creature can submit to this telepathy to become a Joiner. They effectively become another vessel of the hive mind.</p>\n<p>Killiks lose connection to their hive mind at great distances. Those who voluntarily leave the hive mind are referred to as Leavers. It is rare that they are allowed to rejoin their hive without reason.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Killiks are a hive-mind insectoid that typically don't use names. On the offchance they do, it's usually an incomprehensible series of clicking noises. They are receptive to nicknames given by others.</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Kubaz are distinctive for their short, prehensile facial snouts which were used for reaching insects within their hives. They have adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world by learning to survive off their world's native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose.  Due to living on their homeworld of Kubindi—a planet which orbits a blue star—Kubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths; when traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, Kubaz are forced to don protective eyewear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which dwell in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each clan takes the name of their queen they are descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz are able to speak Galactic Basic, though with a strong nasally accent.  When interacting with other species, some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-Kubaz in order to ease communications.  Obsessed with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies, displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such pursuits to be wrong or unlawful.  Due to their diet on Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with sentient insectile species. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kubaz names are usually dominated by harsher sounds, but some names lean more melodic. Surnames are clan-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Shaf, Rizor, Duldril, Kurn, Schnaldiz</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Zhanro, Dizi, Tavo, Agoz, Nuzrem</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Re, Eadzan, Hai, Khu'nar, Mairvuc, Va</p>"

They are diminutive, unimposing, and typically weaker than most humanoids, but they are also quite difficult to track due to their natural speed and stealth.</p>\n<p>While Kushibans are quadrupeds, their forepaws are as manipulative as traditional hands. While kushibans can walk on two legs, they typically run around on four feet since they can move significantly faster that way. </p>\n<p>Kushibans are inherently cute and fuzzy, and more nefarious species often attempt to take them as slaves. Kushibans are social and do not take well to slavery, and they typically don't live long in solitude or captivity. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Kushibans live in a simple, peaceful society on the non-industrialized, lush green planet of Kushibah in the Outer Rim. Kushibans are typically kind and generous, with a playful sense of humor and a penchant for practical jokes. However, if betrayed or angered, Kushibans can be cruel or vindictive, and they have little patience for bullies, simpletons, and misanthropes.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kushiban names are a single word combining both their first and familial names.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Cerlyk, Etyk, Mabbik, Tieko, Widdimur</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Asani, Pritsi, Sibble, Mirax</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Lannik are short, bipedal humanoids with droopy, long ears. Males and females are equally tall, although the latter have a considerably less strong complexity. Their species is, however, much more vigorous and resistant than what its size could suggest. A Lannik's skin tends to be of colours similar to his or her eyes and hair. The species has evolved long pointy ears which allow them to hear better than human ears. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Lannik culture is apparently war loving, and Lanniks feel a great respect for warriors. At the same time, though, they follow a strict centuries-old code of honour. Lannik soldiers have the custom of tying all their hair in a single topknot over their head. Their species is one of fierce warriors, whose abilities have developed fighting against terrible predators and other Lanniks in a long history of wars. Although many regard the Lannik as hotheaded and temperamental, they are quite fearless and clear-headed even in combat, giving them the ability to think their way out of a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>The Lannik do not show their thoughts through their facial expressions, and seem always angry to other species. They are also very stubborn, and are not likely to change career once they chose it. Most males - and many females - serve in the planetary militia, celebrating the species' past as a warrior species. Some take on off-world mercenary work.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Lannik names are generally short. Lanniks don't often give out their surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Minch, Oteg, Vandar, Yaddle, Yoda</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Giro, Lina, Penny, Vona, Zeya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bek, Kaz, Mon, Var, Zin</p>"

Their large finger pads and prehensile toes assist them in climbing. In addition, their large eyes and ears afford them superior sight and hearing over humans. They had the strength to open a powered-down blast door. A height of two meters tall was considered below-average for a Lasat.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Lasat society is held together by a long-standing oral tradition, featuring clever and stealthy heroes. Within the species, those with fighting skills are highly respected, often being members of the Lasan High Honor Guard, a group of highly trained, highly intelligent warriors sworn to protect their homeworld of Lira San. Bo-rifles are a long-standing tradition in Lasat culture, used exclusively by the Honor Guard of Lasan. The warrior way of the Lasat is the Boosahn Keeraw. When a Lasat is bested by a superior opponent in combat, they would give them their weapon.</p>\n<p>Facial hair is an important status symbol in Lasat culture. Those with green eyes and prominent purple stripes are considered to be attractive by others of their species. Juvenile Lasat are noted to climb tree branches. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Lasat names tend to be melodic, with the occasionally harsh tone sprinkled in.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Lurmen's bodies are covered entirely in fur, which range in color from a dark brown to a white-gray, though they do wear garments. They can walk either upright on their two legs, and can also use their arms and legs for faster movement. Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Lurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable. Instead of surnames, lurmen are granted additional names based on their importance to the village. Common lurmen possess one name, with leaders having as many as four. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Fee, Gatt, Nub, Shoo, Yup</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kal, Laa, Shal, Vook, Yiit</p>"

While some looked like their sith pureblood brothers, others have more extreme physical differences, including fin-like growths, a taller form and tough skin. These imposing figures live much shorter lives than other species. They, like the few other creatures that inhabit Korriban, derive sustenance directly from the dark side of the Force, in part of a natural symbiotic relationship where sith—like the massassi—feed on the dark side, and empower it in turn. Thus the massassi have such a high rate of Force-sensitivity that they are considered a naturally Force-sensitive species.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The massassi are fearsome, ruthless, and efficient soldiers. As with the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity for the massassi. They are not only fearsome, but both loyal and formidable warriors that are dedicated to their sith masters. Though they engage in supposedly primitive practices such as sacrifice and hold a strong caste system, their civilization is quite sophisticated. In addition to the focus on war and fighting, the massassi are also loyal and organized. Even though they are not extremely intelligent, they can be trained to carry out complex battle plans and maintain their equipment, starships, and weaponry.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Originating from the pureblood sith, massassi abominations follow many similiar naming conventions. Their names represent primitive virtues in the Sith tongue, and have no surname. </p>\n<p><strong>Males Names.</strong> Asha, Derriphan, H—sk, Jen, </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kintik, Midwan, Siqsa, Ty—k</p>"

The mikkians' most distinctive feature are their motile head-tendrils, with the number, form, and pattern varying between individuals. These head-tendrils primarily serve as sensory organs, particularly detecting sound as a replacement for an ear common in other species. Mikkian head-tendrils also could detect other information, such as humidity, temperature, magnetic direction and radiation. This radiation detection can be detected to the extent that mikkians can \"see\" light and dark, although their eyes are still their primary visual organs. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Mikkians place kinship and integrity above all. In fact, their honesty can come across as blunt or even rude to other sentients. Conversely, mikkians often have trouble adjusting to the more flexible views of other races. Their complex code of honor encompass all things in life, with a particular insistance on matters of warfare. Although they respect warrior traditions, the Mikkians nevertheless value discipline and honor over victory or physical might.</p>\n<p>Different religious traditions exist among the Mikkians, but belief in the Force plays a central role in all of them. In Mikkian society, their head-tendrils have important cultural significance, and as such tendril-reading is used by Mikkian mystics to predict their future. Every facet of the head-tendril contributes to that meaning.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Mikkian names are often short and disyllabic, with a melodic quality to them.

This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can \"see\" Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka's connection to the Force varies by individual.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Miraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves \"brothers\" and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if 'shown' life not connected to the Force. </p>\n<p>Many Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.</p>\n<p>Miraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member's personal life.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Miraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don't use surnames, as they believe they are one family.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth</p>"

Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Mustafarians are an insectoid species of sentients native to the volcanic planet of Mustafar. They are divided into two subspecies: the lanky northern mustafarians, and the stocky southern mustafarians. The southern mustafarians were notable for their greater strength, making them more suited to manual labor. Both subspecies shared many traits, particularly their hardened exoskeletons and leathery skin, which acclimated them to the extreme heat of their volcanic environment.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Mustafarians evolved from arthropods living in the slightly cooler hollows within dormant volcanoes on the surface of Mustafar. As a result of such close living, mustafarian culture is isolationist by nature, though they tolerate trade with other systems. Mustafar hosts scarce minerals and rare metals, making mustafarians an invaluable trade partner.</p>\n<p>Native mustafarians rarely take sides when galactic conflicts rage, instead preferring to keep to themselves and control their own planet. They are daunting enemies when provoked, however.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Mustafarian names are often inspired by displays of competency or bravery, such as recovering large quantities of rare minerals, or successfully taming a lava flea. Their surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aumstrogh, Chivos, Ikt, Ulon</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Altoa, Hailith, Saonji, Yura</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Fal'co, Glost, Mensix, Nek'dem</p>"

Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Instead of noses, they have olfactory glands underneath their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Neimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly. While not all neimoidians are easily intimidated, many prefer to avoid direct combat.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Neimoidian names are usually short and easy to pronounce, to make them more memorable to other species that approach them as consumers. Their surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Lok, Gap, Krinit, Mar, Nute</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Bu, Fia, Feza, Vissi</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dod, How, Kethe, Preelli, Tuuk </p>"

They hold a limited range of facial expressions because they lack the necessary anatomical infrastructure. Their eyes are covered by a protective membrane, being a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their \"staring\" eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating nikto intelligence.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Although lacking in personal charisma, nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Their lives made nikto cunning combatants. Most nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all nikto work for the hutts though most free members of their kind were formerly enslaved. Whilst nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another hutt who \"inherited\" them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped nikto did instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated nikto have to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their \"rightful owners\". In addition, they lacked charisma and preferred to follow orders instead of giving them. As a result, the Nikto were most identified with their Hutt masters.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Nikto names are very complex, hard to pronounce, and harsh sounding. Name length also differs a lot, longer names having apostrophes or dashes. Their names are unisex, with surnames being familiar and optional. </p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Jydabaum, N'rok'ratu, Sussa, Vydgish</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Gozorc, Irtitt, Qegmarg, Umpluurg</p>"

A natural gift for stealth and hand-to-hand combat, Noghri are efficient killing machines with their rending claws and strong olfactory sense that can often determine familial lineage. Their smaller size belies their ruthlessness and potent hunting skills.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Noghri culture relies heavily on honor, with society being clan-based, revolving around the Dukha, a community center in each village. The greatest strength of the Noghri stems from their loyalty and secrecy; when a Noghri takes a job, they always fulfill it, even if it would result in their death. As such, they make exceptional, albeit expensive bodyguards.</p>\n<p>Noghri are loathe to fight with weapons larger than small daggers, believing combat to be a personal celebration to be sullied by use of heavier weapons. As such, it is rare (though not impossible) to see a Noghri wielding a weapon larger than their forearm.</p>\n<p>Each Noghri clan village centers around the Dukha, with each clan being led by a Dynast. The Dukha is inhabited by the clan's Maitrakh, who functions as the storyteller, spiritual leader, and lore keep of the clan.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Noghri names vary from short to long, with female names being typically softer. Surnames are clan-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Cakhmaim, Ezrakh, Khabarakh, Rukh</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Cilnaas, Edvir, Kahr'corvh, Meewalh</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bakh'tor, Eikh'mir, Hakh'khar, Khim'bar</p>"

Nothoiins' appearance has earned their species the nickname of \"Goldskins.\"</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Although nothoiins hail from their eponymous homeworld and star system in the Anoat Sector, they are ubiquitous throughout the Greater Javin Region and Corporate Sectors.  Their history of interstellar exploration and colonization was facilitated by their species' natural spacefaring abilities in both piloting and navigation and necessitated by their home planet's periodically harsh, dry climate.  Droughts on Nothoiin can last for decades, and the wildfires they foster have served as one of the primary factors behind the limited development of the planet's economy beyond the ur-diamond mining industry, which produces the system's chief export.  </p>\n<p>Large-scale emigration from Nothoiin has led members of its native species to seek careers as pilots, navigators, and operatives in numerous criminal enterprises.  Various nothoiin colonies have given rise to a number of different governmental systems running the gamut from representative democracies to autocracies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Nothoiin typically receive a gendered given name and a familial surname.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Amrosio, Jado, Kosimas, Troov</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Elayah, Giranti, Lorinah, Sil</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Caban, Mordu, Plintus, Starstrider</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ortolans are squat, heavily-built humanoid bipeds with long, trunklike noses and beady black eyes. They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body. Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their business affairs by their attachment to food, sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find success as chefs or musicians. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Ortolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education. </p>\n<p>While most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ortolan names are generally short with big sounds. Female names are typically softer. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male names.</strong> Donmb, Hegh, Nax, Parm, Teeb</p>\n<p><strong>Female names.</strong> Bedla, Folfe, Nelni, Phoff, Sallo</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Bigek, Lubum, Nad, Rojool, Somo </p>"

Pa'lowick music runs the gamut of genres and subjects, although religious music is particularly common. Cultural heritage, such as history, genealogy, and parables, is largely passed down orally. Every Pa'lowick community has a dedicated storyteller; the esteem afforded this individual makes the position a coveted one.

At first glance, they only differ from the otherwise similar humans in their blue skin and yellow eyes. The pantorans share many traits with other blue-skinned races, especially the wroonians, and, to a lesser extent, the chiss. The pantorans also seem to have a greater resilience to low temperatures than humans, since they only needed light wardrobe even under extreme cold weather conditions. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Pantoran society developed on Pantora, a world located in a region flush with slavers and spice merchants. Constant run-ins with these types led the pantorans to become fiercely independent and proud. While the pantoran society is democratic, the feudal traditions of marking their foreheads, and cheeks with yellow markings to symbolize lineage persists into the common era. These traditions spurred a cultural interest in genealogy and history, and many pantorans cherish relics from the past such as jewelry which connect them to their noble ancestors or helmets that belonged to great heroes of a bygone age. The old nation states of Pantora are unified under a democratic planetary government, the politics of which are considered an art form. Governed by the Pantoran Assembly, the elected body is led by a Speaker, who balance the power of the chief executive officer, known as the Chairman. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pantoran use sophisticated names with numerous vowels, though often sound similar human names. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Charl, Ikurrece, Maatsu, Pulengo</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Freyu, Jicelli, Nandia, Suya</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Ipujarero, Molidias, Tuteru, Vagana</p>"

With the advent of multiple wars fought in the system, different armies continue to see the aquatic world as a strategic bulwark in the region. Because of this, patrolians have to find work not only off-world, but typically in fields not falling under governmental purview; unfortunately, criminal activities are the most common path. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Patrolian names are usually multisyllabic and sing-songy with lots of open vowels and few fricatives.

The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\".</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However, the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pau'an names are fairly simple, and generally melodic.

They have two long, lanky legs, and two arms that end in three-fingered hands. Their heads are large and elongated, with a tapered skull and an undersized face, a feature which some other species find unsettling. Pykes had two narrow, almond-shaped eyes which could be magenta or blue in color.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Pykes hail from Oba Diah, a terrestrial planet marked by obsidian cliffs. Visitors to Oba Diah view both the population and terrain as unwelcoming. The pyke homeworld serves as the headquarters of the Pyke Syndicate, a criminal dealership within the Spice Cartel that operates in the criminal underworld distributing spice, an illicit substance harvested by slaves in the spice mines of the planet Kessel. To deliver spice to their customers, such as crime families on Coruscant, the Pyke Syndicate relies on smugglers and freighter captains to complete the dangerous Kessel Run. The Pyke Syndicate almost completely controls the production of raw spice in the galaxy, while maintaining tentative alliances with other criminal organizations throughout the galaxy, such as the Black Sun and the Crimson Dawn. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Pyke names are often influenced by naming conventions of other species, with their rarely-used surnames being familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dor, Eife, Qalo, Thok, Zret</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Gali, Taela, Shethni, Vent, Zeeren</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Kemtol, Nek, Pyke, Safet, Welkor </p>"

They have a pair of deep, turquoise eyes and finned hands with suction-tipped fingers. As an amphibious species, they are strong swimmers. They are also bipedal beings that can walk and sit upright. In the two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces, Quarren have gill-like structures that are actually hearing organs. The Quarren are also capable of spitting out clouds of ink as a defensive measure.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Quarren are a very self-centered and proud species, almost to the point of being xenophobic, would coincides with their isolationist behavior. Quarren find Humans to be very crude beings and think Galactic Basic to be very cumbersome and unsuitable for speech. The Quarren instead speak their native language more frequently.</p>\n<p>The Quarren are conservative and practical in their thinking, yet they reminisce more than they look to the future. The Quarren are isolationist, preferring to stay in the depths of the oceans of their homeworld. However, some Quarren make their living in the galaxy as business managers and accountants. The Quarren diligently mine metal ore from the deepest parts of the ocean, where they live deep beneath the waves. Their cities stretch far below the surface.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Quarren names are typically harsh. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Bagker, Jujon, Kibkyl, Qiockish, Yuntoz</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Chobnek, Geeckol, Nukranx, Tsastanx</p>"

Their two brains can cause mental problems when each brain developed a different personality, but also gives them a type of \"telepathy\" which they attribute to an ability to better observe and understand body language. Possessing no noses, the olfactory glands of this species are found in the hands.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Quermians are a gentle, unassuming people. They embrace reason, shun violence, and enjoy interacting with members of other species and cultures. A peaceful society developed on Quermia without arkanian interference, as the quermians evolved on their own in the absence of any predators or outside intervention. As a race they are dedicated to complex philosophical ideas, and many of the galaxy's most prominent diplomats and thinkers are found among their ranks. While they have four arms and are capable of using both sets with ease, they prefer to keep the lower set hidden beneath their robes when dealing with offworlders.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Quermian names are usually one to three syllables long, featuring hard or soft consonants.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Murk, Koa, Jedoo, Vinian </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Gouren, Kindee, Meroo, Kiaa  </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Kreen, Lundi, Raelo, Bactra</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>In appearance, rakata are smooth skinned amphibian-like humanoids that had tall craniums along with eyes that protruded from each side of their heads on short stalks. These bipedal beings have three digit hands that are tipped with claws for digging through packed dirt. As a species, they are uniformly lean and tall; while most rakata have a similar height and weight, females tend to be more slender than males, though just as tall. Rakata are primarily carnivorous, likely stemming from the fact that they are cannibalistic, often making a meal of other species.</p>\n<p>Long term abuse of the Force in their society, exacerbated by a plague, culled the rakata's ability to sense the Force.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Rakatan technology and structures hold the unique property of blending with the Force, creating powerful and long-lasting monuments that are almost impossibly to replicate. Rakatan society is devoted to conquering and enslaving those they deem weak. At the height of its power, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had conquered and enslaved dozens of worlds. They would strip entire planets of their resources and then terraform them to fit their own needs.</p>\n<p>After a plague ravaged their civilization and caused the fall of the Infinite Empire, rakata broke off into smaller tribes rather than a unified organization. Despite their newfound tribal nature, rakata retained their ability to quickly adapt to and appropriate technology.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Rakatan names do not distinguish by gender, and they do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Ceh'let, Orsaa, Skal'nas, Soa, Tul'kar</p>"

The remarkably harsh conditions on the planet nearly drove its population to extinction. For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet's limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.</p>\n<p>Rattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving. Punishment for even the smallest crimes is unnecessarily harsh, which does little to quell that behavior.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Rishii are a sentient, avian species of carnivores which possess two legs ending in four-toed feet, two arms, a tail, and a head. The species' two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii's head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow. Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Native to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet's mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>As with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. Rishii names do not vary based on gender. Rishii are responsive to nicknames given by outsiders. </p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Their homeworld long lost from memory and time, the ryn are a humanoid race of musicians, vagabonds and travelers. The ryn's bodies are covered in soft, short fur, with a head of white hair which is matched by a tuft of hair at the end of their long prehensile tails, excellent for grasping things. Very uniquely ryn in nature, are their beak-like noses that contain fluted holes. These holes allow the ryn to play their 'beaks' like flutes. This talent has been used to communicate between ryn and has uniquely been observed in communication with droids.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Wanderlust consumes the ryn. The ryn are a nomadic species, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of ryn women are used as slave breeding stock. They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings. A peculiar habit is that a ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ryn names have a very melodic tone, taking cues from many different languages from across the galaxy. Ryn do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Corfat, Dirygat, Garya, Nemagary</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Cogesama, Giani, Gypopha, Simeti</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology & Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Selkath are an aquatic species, known for being skilled swimmers and diplomats. Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.</p>\n<p>All members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.</p>\n<h2>Society & Culture</h2>\n<p>Selkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.</p>\n<p>Manaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Selkath names tend to have a flowing quality to it, like a stream of water. They rarely use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Chata, Galas, Qual, Morgo, Shaelas</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Halsuna, Dolmas, Shasa, Ulsuru</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The selonians are carnivores who are believed to have descended from aquatic mammals. Their bodies are covered by a sleek fur and they normally do not wear clothing. However, when working or visiting offworld, they wear appropriate outfits. Their long bodies are equally comfortable walking on either two or four legs. Their long tails serve as a counterbalance for their bodies when standing upright. These tails are equally capable of being used as potent bludgeoning weapons in combat. At the end of their paw-like hands are retractable claws which not only gives them the capacity to dig but also makes them excellent climbers. They have long pointed faces with bristly whiskers as well as long teeth. Most selonians born are infertile females. One in every hundred are male, and one in every five hundred are fertile females.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Despite the massive starship traffic to Corellia, many visitors and even native Corellians know very little of the selonians and their distinctive unique alien culture. In mindset, they are a thoroughly grounded and serious race who are primarily concerned with the safety of their people. This means that the protection of their family dens and their species as a whole was a chief concern. The basis for this line of thinking is because they viewed that the needs of the society outweighed the needs of the individual. To those unaware of the deeper intricacies of the race, the selonians appear as an outgoing, friendly and charitable species. However, their interests rarely go beyond securing the good of their respective den.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Selonian use punctual names with no surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Duldayd, Gov, Krez, Qaran</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Chu, Driacnear, Fiircasa, Shilis</p>"

The species colonized all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen, and their restrictive trade laws (which are unapologetic in how they favor their own kind over off-world traders).  Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.</p>\n<p>A minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen. Due to their natural predatory instincts, Shistavanen commonly find employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters. Many other species react badly to Shistavanen, since their isolationist culture makes them an unfamiliar sight, and their predatory appearance put other species on edge.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Shistavanen first names typically sound graceful, while their surnames are more gutteral.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Squibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with little regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Names.</strong> Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior</p>\n<p><strong>Nicknames.</strong> Galan, Meela, Wilpher</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Ssi-ruuk are a predatory, warm-blooded saurian species gifted with ferocious strength, remarkable speed, and sharp fangs and claws, traits that serve them well in the volcanic jungles of their homeworld of Lwhekk. Their muscular forms combined with their powerful tails make them very agile hunters, and their colorfully-scaled hides have been proven to be resistant even to blaster bolts. From their nostrils, two scent-tongues protrude that grant them enhanced olfactory senses, compensating for the poor vision afforded them by their dark, three-lidded eyes. No Ssi-ruu has ever been known to be Force-sensitive.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The citizens of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium follow a rigid caste system in which their station in society is determined by the color of the scales they are born with. Among these, the brown-scaled outcasts are regarded as the lowest of the low, and have no place in the Imperium beyond menial labor or death at birth. Deeply xenophobic and religious, the Ssi-ruuk view the rest of the galaxy as populated by lesser beings whose worlds rightfully belong to the Imperium. Despite their fierce nature, most ssi-ruuk are afraid of dying on a world unconsecrated by their priest caste, as they believe their souls would be doomed, so they harvest and \"entech\" the life-energy of other species to power droids that fight for them. The entechment process is torturous and painful to its victims, and is the main power source of Ssi-ruuvi technology.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ssi-ruuvi names are difficult to pronounce and gender neutral. Many ssi-ruuk adopt nicknames to make the lives of their associates easier. Ssi-ruuk do not have surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Firwirrung, Ivpikkis, Sh'tk'ith, Th'twirirl, Yifaii</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>A diminutive species of near-humans, Sullustans bear round, tapered skulls. Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears. Their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision. Due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. Many choose to wear special visors to prevent further damage. Some Sullustans tattoo their heads as a form of individual expression.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Sullustans are outgoing and mercantile, friendly and pragmatic. As a species they are altogether lacking in xenophobia. Though fond of practical jokes and extremely shrewd in their business dealings, they are eager to explore and travel the galaxy. Inquisitive by nature, some have described Sullustans as reckless, especially for their preference to learn and discover whenever possible through personal experience. Sullustans organize themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each clan consists of one polyandrous female, several husbands, and their young. Unmated females, known as \"Fems\", are active members of their communities until they reach breeding status, called \"Ready\", when they choose their mates.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Male names are typically longer than female names. Surnames are based on Warren-clan.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Duedt, Oshror, Partheen, Throthinnitz</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Asulu, Eldo, Tri, Vo, We</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Frovarr, Jeard, Plonr, Tsah, Vhiibb</p>"

Talz have four eyes, which are also adaptations to their native environment. The larger set of eyes are shut during the day, when sunlight reflects off the snow with dazzling brightness—able to blind sensitive optical organs—leaving the smaller set to navigate with. Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld's moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Talz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society. They work in unison, and treat the entire clan as one single familial entity. Resources on Ordo Plutonia are often scarce, which leads to warring among Talz tribes. However, the clans are adept at forming a unified front when they face a common enemy.</p>\n<p>Talz are large, brutal creatures and are often used as guards and enforcers. Sometimes they are taken as slaves, though it's rare; they are rebellious against authority and don't take well to slavery. There are rumors that Talz are captured for scientific experimentation.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Talz names are fairly gutteral and are characterized by their harsh nature. Female names are typically longer than male names. Surnames are clan-based, though it's rare that a Talz shares them with non-Talz.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Drak, Fedirk, Imom, Ke, Twift</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Ilnuno, Ontuga, Utrukk, Zimtucc</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Dic, Noetoc, Suptat, Wume, Zapak</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Tarasins are tall reptilians covered in translucent scales that allows the species' color-changing skin below to show through. Tarasins also have a colorful fan of flesh and scales—known as a kampo—that opens around their heads when they experience strong emotional distress, which can be a detriment to negotiations, as it is difficult for a tarasin to hide discomfort. This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms—known as a sa'tosin—which give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch'hala tree is sacred. This may have been influenced by the trees having a similar ability to shift their colors as the tarasin, but it is also the most unique tree on Cularin. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Tarasin names are generally very soft and melodic. Names are agendered, and surnames are not used.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Feliosa, Misona, Nissira, Vylana, Ziransa</p>"

Nomadic and clan-based, the taung greatly value strength and honor, with pragmatism and ruthlessness being common traits amongst them. Originally waging war as a means of ritual worship to their god Kad Ha'rangir, the taung eventually became the Mandalorians, and - under the leadership of Mandalore the Indomitable - the act of war itself became the center of Mandalorian worship, and to wage war is to <em>be</em> divine.</p>\n<p>Despite their volatile nature, the taung are far from primitive, and maintain a high priority in procuring the latest technological advancements whenever possible.</p>\n<p>The Mandalorian armor that has become iconic throughout the galaxy originally began with the culture's taung founders, with their unique helmets and war masks being forged in the image of the taung's face, including slanted outer angles and a pointed chin. However, the armor is quite sparse among the taung as they believe that unarmed combat brings the highest honor.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Taung names reflect their practical nature, typically choosing names that correspond to traits they deem desirable. Their names are rarely gender specific and can apply to either male or female.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The original appearance of the theelin is officially uncertain, as almost all known \"theelin\" are not full-blooded specimens, but hybrids. It is possible that some aspects of these individuals' appearances are not from their theelin genes, but from other near-human ancestors. Most, however, have vividly colored hair and pale skin, often mottled with colorful spots. Unfortunately, a series of mutations arose among later generations of theelin. These mutations have led to genetic incompatibilities within their species, making it impossible to produce offspring. Even attempts to continue their species by cross-breeding with other near-humans could not stop the theelin slide towards extinction, due to the high infant mortality rates such couplings suffer from. Theelin began inevitably dwindling in number—only a few million theelin and part-theelin remain by the time the Republic fell, and pure theelin are presumed extinct by the fall of the Empire. Some of their greatest works are produced in these years, however, as an epitaph for a dying people. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Theelin performers and artists created many of the galaxy's greatest works of art. The Theelin Divas, an all-female religious order, are recognized by many scholars of music as the greatest singers in the galaxy. Because of the rarity of the theelin, many female theelin and part-theelin are named \"Diva\" at birth, in hopes that they will develop the musical talent necessary to continue the traditions of the Diva order.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Theelin use names similar to those in their community, typically human-similar names with exotic tinges.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dhess, Gooti, J—nsone, Qylett</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> F—niss, Diva, Prystill, Saqua</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Joolie, Masozi, Oasay, Rellik</p>"

These tails are very strong and are commonly used to carry large objects. When meditating or at rest, a thisspiasian will coil their tail beneath their torso, reducing their height by several feet. They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Thisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian's outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm. This is far from the truth, however, as they are in truth a very passionate species below the surface. A thisspiasian who doesn't meditate as often as they should will often be prone to otherwise atypical emotional outbursts.</p>\n<p>Thisspias is ruled by a hereditary leader called the Blood Monarch. Due to their seemingly archaic ruling structure, thisspiasians are often considered out-of-touch. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Thisspiasian names typically are composed of two similar sounding syllables.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Tiss'shar are bipedal therapods descended from predatory reptilians native to the humid jungle continents of Tiss'sharl. They are relatively strong and agile, with long necks, slender torsos, wider hips, and a short but wiry tail. Their mouths are filled with short, sharp teeth, and their large tongues are pink and constantly moving. Their large eyes appear glassy as a result of the clear, resilient film that covered and protected them. Many tiss'shar have prominent sickle-shaped claws on the first toe of their feet; some also possessed a crest of feathers atop their heads.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tiss'shar social structure is inextricably tied to business. Nearly all tiss'shar families have a corporation as a patron, which provides the family with its material needs in exchange for the dedicated labor of its members. Patron corporations regularly supply food, housing, health care, education, and security services. The predatory instincts of the tiss'shar, redirected into the realm of business, often serve them well. While no stereotype fully defines the species, they often were considered aggressive, resourceful, calculating businessbeings. These traits also made them excellent assassins and gunfighters, renowned galaxywide for their efficiency. Most tiss'shar had an appreciation for the art of the deal, and conducted their business legitimately; even those who chose the path of the assassin remembered that they were conducting business and respected their contracts.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Tiss'shar names are segmented, with males receiving an additional \"tail name.\" Surnames always come last.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Si-Di-Ri, Tra-Skan-Lor, Geor-Dan-Thi </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Von-Ra, Ura-Vaza, Shu-Xangiz, Sav-Lork</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Tognath are a sentient species native to Yar Togna. Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Tognath use generally simple, nongendered names, without bothering with surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Darjia, Essec, Irion, Tathak</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The Togorian people are a feline warrior species native to the planet Togoria. They are large, heavy-framed bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians grow up to 7 feet tall, while adult males can reach up to 9 feet. They're covered in gray-white, black, brown, or orange fur, often with colorful spots or stripes. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Togorians have a unique cultural division between their sexes. They evolved as nomadic hunters of creatures like the bist and etelo, surviving on the wilderness as apex predators. As time went on, a rift in their society developed between the two sexes. Males were drawn to continue their lifestyle as nomads and hunters for their people, while females tended to prefer remaining in permanent camps and contributed the vast majority of their species technological developments. This division has continued into modern times, with males continuing their nomadic traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in villages and cities. Males visit their mates for about a month each year, but otherwise the sexes live completely separate lives. Whether in spite of this separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are typically monogamous and devoted to their chosen mates.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Togorian names tend to be short and primal-sounding. Female names tend to include softer consonants and more vowels, while male names are typically harsher. Togorians do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong>  Mezgraf, Mlatar, Morto, Mrrov, Torr</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Coelle, Elotis, H'sishi, Kra'ake, Rrowv</p>"

While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. </p>\n<p>Toydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Toydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there. Male names are generally shorter than female names. Female names always end in a vowel. </p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dod, Nesteddo, Tul, Zloomroo</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Fefiffe, Lenlibo, Nugni, Zoldibu</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Daab, Faabb, Kepo, Mitra, Vulba</p>"

Some have tusks that they use in blood duels. They are strong and resilient, and their life-spans reached up to 200 standard years. They notably eat genteslugs.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Ugnaughts are ruled by councils comprised of elected officers. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their \"blood profession\", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.</p>\n<p>When greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response. Usage of the common galactic greeting \"yaa-yaah\" is considered a personal insult to Ugnaughts. If this occurrs, it was advisable to duck and cover, as various mechanical implements will be thrown one's way. </p>\n<p>Ugnaughts are often enslaved as they are fairly meek.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ugnaught names are generally concise. Female names sound more cheerful. Surnames are determined by blood profession.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Banax, Dral, Durn, Togre, Yirkux</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Admeva, Olnito, Ruskor, Vurlilli</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Col, Gnatro, Mikk, Roc, Sag</p>"

Considered exotic for being one of the few sentient species to fall outside the standard classificiations of birds, mammals, etc. Their bodies consist of cytoplasm, which can vary in colors and shade, bound by a slime-coated membrane. Being amorphic, ugors can assume nearly any shape, and can exude pseudopodia limbs such as crude arms, mouths, and sensory organs, although a globular form was the most comfortable and easy to maintain. Due to their unique physiology and evolution, they are able to digest substances that would prove toxic to other species, and can subsist on other species' trash. While most maintain globular form, some who interact with humanoid species will wear EVA suits or armor to give themselves a humanoid appearence. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Ugor society revolves around trading and scavenging; they are famed for providing equipment to nascent civilizations and for salvaging wreckage from failed ones. The beings are supremely adaptable and astutely able to get what they want from others. Ugor business deals are extremely complex, incorporating opaque knots of loans, interest, and payment plans. Ugors have an intense love of trash, which they base their religions off, and excel at those skills that are useful in their pursuit of rubbish collection: a member of the species' education emphasizes skills related to scavenging and starship operation (although members of the species rarely became more than passable pilots).</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Ugor names typically consisted of two parts, with no notable difference between the genders. Ugor do not use surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> ArrGack, GrrKack, SplrMuck</p>"

Only those within the ten highest caste tiers were given opportunities to leave their homeworld. Because of the cutthroat machinations required to get there, Umbarans in the wider galaxy are known as skilled, ruthless politicians. This reputation is enhanced by the Umbarans' talents for reading and influencing the emotions of others.</p>\n<p>Umbara developed its own technological advances separate from galactic society, and possessed technology that was in many fields far more advanced than the galactic standard. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Umbaran names are typically no more than one or two syllables.

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Voss are humanoid sentients with a high rate of Force-sensitivity who display prominent sexual dimorphism. The male Voss have blue skin and bright orange eyes, while the females have red skin and azure eyes. The Voss do not have hair or distinct pupils, and posess unique patterns of markings on their face, neck, and body, a trace of their shared ancestry with Gormak. Their voices have a slight mechanical tinge to them, making them sound somewhat like a droid or machine. Voss undogo a physical, developmental change during their marriage ceremonies (known as the Rite of Ardor) and do not develop sexually prior to the performance of these rituals.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The Voss species resides in the isolated mountain-top city of Voss-Ka and is vastly outnumbered on their homeworld by its other native sentient species, the Gormak, who are extremely hostile toward them and from whom they arose. Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style. The entire Voss society is guided by the Force visions of Voss Mystics, which are considered infallible without exception.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>All Voss have two short names, connected by a hyphen, with the family name being the second one.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Char, Edan, Fadith, Nodin, Orin</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Amin, Magra, Tala, Weylin, Yana</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> -Ko, -La, -Po, -Rae, -Va</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Vurks are the predominant sentient species of the planet Sembla. They are tall, reptilian humanoids with bulbous dark eyes and sweeping head crests. Their hands and feet have three digits each, one of which was opposable. They have distinguishing gray-green, leathery skin. Being able to breathe both water and air, they are perfectly adapted to travel Sembla's warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They share a strong nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors.  </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Young Vurk males are married off by their parents; those who failed to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives. Because their way of living resulted in virtually no sizable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were generally considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy; however, that was not true. They are very intelligent and believe in a highly developed philosophical tradition that emphasizes personal integrity and individual freedom and encourage personal honesty. Their compassionate and calm manner made them better than average diplomats.</p>\n<p>Vurks are very family-oriented. It is common for multiple generations to remain in the same location as a single household, with the eldest family member being the patriarch or matriarch and making the decision for the entire family.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Vurk names are traditionally two to three syllables. Female names typically end with a vowel, while male names vary. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Coleman, Jadran, Milanko, Zlatko</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Elka, Iryna, Miglena, Tanya, Verka</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Cheevochik, Provric, Trebor, Vorgecz</p>"

Almond-shaped eyes dominate a small head perched atop a long neck. Their brain is split between two parts of their body; the part located in the skull controls primitive emotions and basic body functions, while another portion in their chest controls higher functions such as creative thinking and logic. It's believed that xexto's body structure and lightning-fast reflexes developed to help them escape predators while pursuing their own prey, there is no question that genetic manipulation forever altered their evolutionary development.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Although the Old Republic had long since outlawed experimentation on sentient beings, unscrupulous arkanian geneticists continued to search for primitive sentients on distant planets as fodder for their experiments. One such group found the xexto's forbears- a society of loosely organized hunter-gatherer tribes taking shelter in the trees of Troiken. Independently, they developed technologically advanced civilizations, and were on the verge of attaining interstellar travel when Republic scouts contacted them. Difficult terrain and dangerous predators found on their homeworld have led many Xexto to admire and encourage risk-taking. Despite their thrillseeking nature and willingness to take risks, xexto are generally well mannered and even-tempered. Questioning a Xexto's bravery is one way to make him or her angry. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Xexto have very unique names, often sounding odd to outsiders. Surnames are familiar but optional.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Babading, Cicity, Gastoro, Maila, Qinla</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Cherum, Hevad, Qatabas, Riived, Serap</p>"

The species possesses six fingered hands that have retractable dewclaws. Each one is located on the inside of the wrist above their six-fingered hands. Their dewclaws shoot from a sheath of a skin beneath their cadaverous hands and are capable of being retracted. When extended fully, the wrist blades reach about a foot in length, and are used in close combat and blood sacrifices. The Yevetha also possess a greater tolerance for g-forces when compared to Human pilots.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Within their society, blood is an important aspect of their culture and is a central focus of their religious belief system. This has resulted in them becoming a particularly violent species. For the Yevetha, death is not to be feared. They are described as being dutiful, attentive, cautious but also fatalistic in their view of the universe. When fighting against other foes, Yevetha are notable for being ruthless fighters who never surrender even in the face of certain defeat. Due to the brutal nature of their society, the Yevetha do not possess a single jail, penitentiary or stockade as they believe there is no need for such facilities. In fact, they do not possess a word in their language for either convict or incarcerate.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Yevetha names are sharp and are kept to one syllable, not varying significantly based on gender. Surnames are familial.</p>\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Ral, Var, Cax, Tav, Fol, Sip, Nov</p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Faalk, Naalar, Giinn, Ralle, Xoota</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Zeltrons are one of the few near-human species that differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. </p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It's not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol </p>\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Lyshaa, Dani, Vianna, Chantique </p>\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'Pow, Blue, Duare, Sapphire</p>"

                "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>The zilkins are a bipedal, amphibious species discernible by their diminutive stature and stalk eyes. Their homeworld, Zilk, has many dense jungles and swamps deemed impossible to navigate by most species. Only the zilkins themselves, evolved from worm-like creatures, were able to easily slip through the gaps in the tangled, coarse foliage. Their powerful legs make them adept at swimming and leaping.</p>\n<p>Zilkin also have bulbous chins which inflate with excess air while they are speaking.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Their short lifespans cause zilkins to be one of the fastest learners in the galaxy, capable of learning in weeks what takes other species months. Zilkins live in large communities woven into the thick clumps of trees on Zilk. Whenever a dispute occurs, zilkins turn to a ritualistic form of debate where everyone affected voices their opinion on the matter. Whoever croaks their views the loudest and most confidently, wins. As a result, zilkins tend to be quite opinionated.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the zilkins remained unknown to the galaxy at large, simply because few individuals had any interest in visiting Zilk, let alone exploring its notoriously impenetrable jungles. Having lived in isolation for so many generations, and often mocked for their size, zilkins tend to exhibit cantankerous behavior toward other species. Despite this, a number of zilkins leave their homeworld and take an active role in galactic politics, gaining the planet representation in the Senate.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Zilkin names are usually clear and concise.

Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws and claws extending from their hands.

Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity. </p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>A warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.</p>\n<p>Zygerrian society is organized into clans and classes.
